After all, it wasn’t until later that a lot of his fans grew to know <a href=#>a lot of facts about 50 Cent</a> but at the time, there was one fact about him that was common knowledge, he’d survived being shot nine times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that 50 Cent seemed so tough when he was introduced to the world, it has been really interesting to see how his image has changed over the years. For example, some os his fans are convinced that <a href=#>50 Cent now makes a living being petty</a> given all of the feuds that he seems to relish being a part of.</p><p>Amazingly enough, a long-lasting fast-food company somehow got itself in 50 Cent’s bad books. Even though a lot of people initially wrote off the lawsuit 50 Cent filed against Taco Bell as nothing more than a joke, it wouldn’t take too long for it to become shockingly serious.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Does 50 Cent Make His Money These Days?</a></span></p><h2 id=famous-feuds>Famous Feuds</h2><p>Throughout rap history, there are loads of examples of performers who’ve made it a habit to get involved in new feuds so regularly that it can be hard to keep track of all their enemies. For example, Eminem was willing to feud with just about anyone including Christina Aguilera, Machine Gun Kelly, Everlast, Moby, Insane Clown Posse, and even Will Smith somehow. Just like his longtime friend Eminem, 50 Cent clearly gets a kick out of taking verbal shots at anyone who irritates him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout his career, <a href=#>50 Cent has feuded with so many of his fellow stars</a> that it would be foolhardy to try and list them all here. For example, at one point or another 50 Cent has had some choice words for musicians like Kanye West, Diddy, The Game, Lil Wayne, Lloyd Banks, Rick Ross, Fat Joe, and Megan Thee Stallion among others. That said, the verbal shots that 50 Cent took at some of those performers seemed to be in good fun whereas he appeared to have much more serious problems with others in that group.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>50 Cent's Best Friends (And His Biggest Feuds)</a></span></p><p>In the vast majority of cases, rappers seem to save their vitriol for their fellow hip-hop stars. When it comes to 50 Cent, however, he has made it very clear that he has no problem trolling pretty much anyone. After all, in the past, 50 Cent has called out people like Vivica A. Fox, Gayle King, and even Oprah. 50 Cent also once had a war of words with Floyd Mayweather and while they once claimed their battle was for publicity, it felt very serious at times given the nastiness of the words they had for one another. For example, 50 Cent once claimed that Mayweather is illiterate and offered to donate $750k to charity if the boxer could read a page from a “Harry Potter” book.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though a lot of 50 Cent’s celebrity feuds have been amazing, his most entertaining beef has to be the one he has with Ja Rule. After all, it was pretty hilarious when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Cent bought 200 tickets to a Ja Rule performance</a> so that he could throw his rival off by keeping the front row of his concert empty. If that isn’t epic trolling, then nothing is. Of course, it has to be noted that Ja Rule claims that 50 Cent’s claims about buying the tickets were a lie but either way, his efforts succeeded as most people believe the epic prank took place.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Things Fans Don't Know About Ja Rule's Private Life</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=an-amazing-lawsuit>An Amazing Lawsuit</h2><p>In recent years, several different companies have decided to try to make jokes online to make themselves seem cool. In some cases, those efforts have been surprisingly effective as evidenced by the coverage that Wendy’s Twitter account often gets. Unfortunately for this company, however, one of Taco Bell’s attempts to be funny backfired epically.</p><p>During the late-2000s, one of the people in charge of promoting Taco Bell wrote up a fake letter they supposedly sent to 50 Cent. In the fake letter, Taco Bell tries to convince 50 Cent to change his name to 79 Cent, 89 Cent, or 99 Cent in order to tie in with the prices of some of the things on their menu at the time. Furthermore, the fake letter claimed that the company would donate $10,000 to charity if 50 Cent agreed to the name change.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Instead of laughing off Taco Bell’s joke letter or agreeing to their terms, 50 Cent lawyered up and filed a $4 million lawsuit. In their court filing, 50 Cent’s lawyers pointed out that Taco Bell didn’t actually send him the letter at all. Instead, they solely sent the letter to the press.</p><p>If most people saw a headline about 50 Cent suing Taco Bell, they likely would laugh it off as nothing more than a joke. In reality, however, it was pretty clear that the company tried to get some free promotion by playing off the rapper’s intellectual property. With that in mind, it makes sense that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taco Bell wound up settling 50 Cent’s lawsuit out of court</a>. While it is clear that Taco Bell came out on the losing side of things, all parties agreed to keep the terms of the lawsuit’s settlement confidential. Given that 50 Cent has had some well-known financial problems, he must have been delighted for the payday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Fans React To Lil Nas X Becoming Taco Bell’s ‘Chief Impact Officer’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmbGllk5q7tb%2BMoaClmaKevLa%2FjKWYsKulnsFurcaaoKerpGLBoq%2FOZpmepJxir6avwKacZquYpLCstc2go7Jlo5q%2FqrvUrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danny-masterson-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Danny Masterson Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
