At twelve, he was competing nationally, catching the eye of bigger brands.</p><p>This early success fueled his passion, leading him to drop out of high school at 16, and chase his dream of skateboarding in Mecca, Southern California.</p><p>There, he turned pro in 1991, competing internationally and landing a coveted sponsorship with Alien Workshop, a company that would produce his signature skateboards. Dyrdek's entrepreneurial spirit blossomed alongside his skating skills.</p><p>He founded Orion Trucks, a skateboard accessory company, at the young age of 17. California proved to be a turning point.</p><p>Dyrdek secured a major deal with skatewear giant DC Shoes, becoming a key influencer for their brand for over two decades. This partnership not only brought financial rewards but also helped propel him to the global stage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By 1995, Dyrdek was a skateboarding fixture, competing and performing exhibitions across the world. This international recognition further solidified his reputation and likely boosted his earnings through competition winnings and exhibition fees.</p><p>Additionally, his signature shoe line with DC Shoes, launched in 1995, became a long-lasting and undoubtedly lucrative collaboration.</p><p>In 1999, he established Dyrdek Enterprises, laying the groundwork for his future ventures beyond skateboarding.</p><p>While still competing at the highest levels, like his sixth-place finish in park skating at the 2000 X Games, Dyrdek continued his entrepreneurial pursuits. He founded Silver Trucks in 2003, expanding his skateboarding hardware empire.</p><p>Finally, in 2005, Dyrdek came full circle, giving back to his hometown by building the Rob Dyrdek/DC Shoes Skate Plaza, the first of its kind funded by a skater himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This project cemented his legacy in skateboarding while showcasing his business acumen.
