They’re really, really close.”</p><p>In November 2017, Taylor, 37, told Today’s Parent that being part of a “bigger family” has had its perks.</p><p>“Everybody develops this innate ability to figure out how to compromise, work with others and realize that the entire world doesn’t revolve around you. It also encourages you to be an individual because you can clearly see your differences from a brother or sister,” he explained at the time. “I see that with my kids: They’re very different, but I see that they love and respect one another.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Zac-Hanson-Kate-Hanson-Pregnant-With-5th-Child-2.jpg><p>He added that Jordan, 18, Penelope, 15, River, 14, Viggo, 12, Wilhelmina, 8, Claude, 2, and Maybellene, 1 month, were part of his “crew” when they “hit the road” with him and Hanson last year.</p><p>“Because of the timing of these shows and everything going on with us, we decided now was a great time to stick together and do this as a family,” his wife, <strong>Natalie Hanson</strong>, wrote via Instagram in June 2019. “So, we are back on the road! It’s been awhile since we’ve had the whole crew with us full time and its crazy to think how little they were in years past. Now we have these big kids who are so cool and fun and help out big time. So all you parents of little ones out there, hang in there! It gets awesome!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGazmZNitaK60qilrGWnnrOmecqaq55lmah6sb7EoKWapqRixKrAx2ZsraBdmLWquMNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-admiral-wilson-memo-pentagon-declassified-ufo-videos-are-mysterious.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Admiral Wilson Memo?
