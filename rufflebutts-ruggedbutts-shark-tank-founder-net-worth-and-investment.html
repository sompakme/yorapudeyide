Unable to find a similar product for her own children, she saw an opportunity to fill a gap in the market. In 2007, she and her husband Mark established RuffleButts, focusing on affordability, fashion, and quality. In 2011, they launched RuggedButts, a clothing line for boys. RuffleButts and RuggedButts have grown rapidly over the years, with annual revenues reaching millions of dollars by their fifth year. The brands are available in hundreds of retailers worldwide.</p><h3>Why Rufflebutts?</h3><p>Amber Schaub’s personal experience played a significant role in the birth of RuffleButts. Growing up, she cherished the adorable ruffled bloomers she wore as a child. However, when she couldn’t find a similar product for her own children, Amber decided to create her own line of ruffled clothing. This decision led to the creation of RuffleButts, a brand that captures the charm and nostalgia of ruffled bloomers while offering modern, stylish designs.</p><p>“RuffleButts was born out of a desire to provide adorable and affordable ruffled clothing for children, just like the ones I loved wearing as a child.” – Amber Schaub</p><p>RuffleButts quickly gained popularity for its unique and playful designs. The brand’s commitment to affordability, fashion, and quality resonated with parents worldwide, leading to its rapid growth and expansion. In 2011, RuggedButts was introduced to cater to the needs of boys, further solidifying RuffleButts’ position as a leading children’s clothing brand.</p><p>RuffleButts and RuggedButts have become go-to choices for parents looking to dress their children in stylish, comfortable, and high-quality clothing.

Our products offer unique designs, affordability, and quality, catering to the fashion-forward preferences of parents and caregivers.”</p><p><b>Lori Greiner</b>, one of the esteemed Sharks, recognized the value of RuffleButts and offered $600,000 for a slightly higher equity stake of 9%. The deal was accepted by Amber and Mark during the show, showcasing their ambition and commitment to further grow their business.</p><p>However, as it happens in the world of entrepreneurial ventures, not all deals made on the show come to fruition.
