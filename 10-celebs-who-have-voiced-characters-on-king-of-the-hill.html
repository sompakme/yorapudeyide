Some of his most notable include, playing Cousin Itt in&nbsp;The Addams Family,&nbsp;Smooth Move in&nbsp;Turbo,&nbsp;and playing himself in a dozen more films and shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-mcconaughey--rad-thibodeaux><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Matthew McConaughey- Rad Thibodeaux</span></h2><p>Matthew McConaughey played one of the most memorable guest stars on&nbsp;King of the Hill, where he starred as Rad Thibodeaux, a self-proclaimed genius and confident man who easily wins over the very gullible Luanne in season three, episode 14.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Matthew McConaughey Teases He'd Do A Sequel Of This Film</a></span></p><p>One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fan of the show wrote on Fandom</a>, "I don't like Matthew McConaughey but I do like character Rad too bad he only appeared in one episode." McConaughey did an excellent job playing the role and may have<a href=#> even seen a little of Rad in himself</a> since he is known for his charisma and charm.</p><h2 id=johnny-depp--victor><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Johnny Depp- Victor</span></h2><p>Johnny Depp has played countless roles but fans may not have known that he was a guest star on&nbsp;King of the Hill.&nbsp;In season eight, episode 20, titled&nbsp;Hank's Back,&nbsp;the actor played Yogi Victor, an arrogant yoga instructor that helps Hank Hill overcome a bank injury he suffered working at Strickland Propane.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the first time Depp lent his voice</a> to a cartoon character.

Hank Hill must supply the entire local Renaissance Festival with propane and that is where he meets the annoying king who won't ever get out of character. In the end, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">viewers get to hear Rickman use a Southern accent</a>, which is by far, one of the greatest things about the episode.</p><h2 id=chris-rock-roger-booda-sack><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Chris Rock-Roger "Booda" Sack</span></h2><p>Viewers of the show meet character Roger "Booda" Sack, an energetic stand-up comedian who also teaches at "Defensive Driving School" in season two, episode 16, titled&nbsp;Traffic Jam.&nbsp;<a href=#>Chris Rock gives his voice to the character</a>, who ends up getting a job at Strickland Propane thanks to Hank Hill.
