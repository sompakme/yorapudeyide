From his musical role in A Star Is Born, dramatic role in the Silver Linings Playbook, to his comedic character in The Hangover series, he's proven his openness to try almost every possible challenging acting opportunity in film. However, Bradley faces a more challenging role outside Hollywood—his love life. After going through several ups and downs in his relationships, is he willing to go the extra mile to prevent someone else from committing the same mistakes he did?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Is Bradley Cooper overstepping a line, or does he only care for Robert Pattinson that much? Are the rumors about him warning Robert made up or is there truth to it? Keep reading to find out the truth...</p><h2 id=how-did-suki-waterhouse-meet-bradley-cooper>How Did Suki Waterhouse Meet Bradley Cooper?</h2><p>At 47 years old, Bradley Cooper is still a male figure that fans and celebrities gush over. Bradley is even on the top of the list of male celebrities <a href=#>Selena Gomez, Lady Gaga, and Amy Schumer want to be their next boyfriend.</a></p><p>However, one star had already caught Bradley's heart even before other female celebrities could attempt to make a move. The British model and actress Suki Waterhouse first met Bradley Cooper at the 2013 Elle Style Awards, where the two were seatmates in the event.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is Bradley Cooper's Rumored Girlfriend, Huma Abedin?</a></span></p><p>The two had an instant connection which urged them to get to know each other more at the event's after-party. It didn't take long for the couple to go out on dates and red carpet events together, and despite the mixed positive and negative comments about them, they didn't seem fazed about it when they began dating.</p><h2 id=what-happened-between-suki-waterhouse-and-bradley-cooper>What Happened Between Suki Waterhouse And Bradley Cooper?</h2><p>After two years of dating, they officially broke up in 2015. One of the main reasons<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Bradley and Suki broke up is that they had a relatively big age difference</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bradley was already in his midlife, at 40 years old, when he and Suki were dating. He was already planning to start a family and settle down. However, Suki Waterhouse, who was only 23 years old then, had no plans to slow down in building her Hollywood career to start a family.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Inside Robert Pattinson's Relationship With Girlfriend Suki Waterhouse</a></span></p><p>As she was still at the stage where she was only starting to make a name for herself in Hollywood, focusing on her career was her top priority. She even tells The Daily Beast, "I [Suki Waterhouse] got cast in [The Bad Batch], and then my personal life [with Bradley Cooper] just... So many bad things happened! It was crazy. When your heart feels like there's a hole here. I was like that."</p><h2 id=is-suki-waterhouse-engaged-to-robert-pattinson>Is Suki Waterhouse Engaged To Robert Pattinson?</h2><p>It is a mystery how <a href=#>Robert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse first met</a>. After Robert became famous for his breakthrough role as Edward Cullen in Twilight, he gained millions of followers who wanted constant updates about his whereabouts worldwide. That's why the fact that the Twilight actor and Suki Waterhouse managed to get to know each other without any suspicions from fans is still impressive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was only in 2018 that fans knew about Robert and Suki's relationship after the couple became publicly affectionate toward each other. Almost four years into their relationship, little is still known about them, whether it be their date whereabouts, relationship status, or plans together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Robert Pattinson Bought A Modest Home Despite His $100 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Despite rumors of the <a href=#>two actors secretly getting engaged</a>, Robert and Suki seem like they are currently happy and contented with staying as girlfriend and boyfriend for now. With their careers still thriving in 2022, the two seem to have a common goal of putting their job at the top of their current priorities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=suki-waterhouse-threw-shade-at-bradley-cooper>Suki Waterhouse Threw Shade At Bradley Cooper</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Suki Waterhouse posted a TikTok video on January 2022</a> with the caption, "Can't believe I [Suki Waterhouse] let someone who looks like me with this filter break my heart," which she immediately deleted to prevent any further hostile clamor about her and ex-boyfriend Bradley Cooper.</p><p>Fans then began to wonder if the initial sources that said Bradley and Suki were still 'friends' after their break-up was true. After The Bad Batch actress indirectly talks about Bradley Cooper, it seems that Suki is not entirely fond of Bradley, even as a friend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Especially when rumors circulated about Bradley secretly telling Robert to watch out for Suki's intentions for getting in a relationship with him, it could have been one of the reasons Suki Waterhouse got upset with her ex-boyfriend.</p><h2 id=bradley-cooper-did-not-warn-robert-pattinson-about-dating-suki-waterhouse>Bradley Cooper Did Not Warn Robert Pattinson About Dating Suki Waterhouse</h2><p>Contrary to the rumors about Bradley secretly telling Robert to be cautious about dating her ex-girlfriend, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Suggest.com</a> says it is wholly false, and the original tabloids that disseminated the stories entirely fabricated it.</p><p>Bradley Cooper and Robert Pattinson did not have any interactions in which they talked about their relationship with Suki Waterhouse. Bradley likely has no plans to get involved in any of Suki's businesses as he doesn't seem to be bothered by her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq5mUobK6ecKopqmdomK0qr7Ln6minZ6ZerTByqJksJmkmr%2Bpu9SsnGavkae7prCMq6abnaKperGt062gp6ufo3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daydream-nation-trailer-kat-dennings-gets-sexy.html><span>←</span><span>Daydream Nation Trailer: Kat Dennings Gets Sexy</span></a>
