One of the known victims of his dating service hustle recently suggested that Timothy Blair may have faked his own death in order to escape his debts. A Mississippi judge has now issued a warrant for the supposedly deceased rapper’s arrest.</p><p>“I need proof,” Hernando-based prosecutor Steven Jubera told <a href=# id=auto-tag_news_3 data-tag=news>news</a> station WREG. He convicted Blair in 2011, and filed a motion with a judge on Tuesday (May 21) to revoke the man’s probation. “I need a death certificate showing that’s he’s dead because as far as I’m concerned, he’s alive.” He also added that if Tim Dog is indeed alive, he’ll have pulled off the greatest scam in the history of hip-hop. Apparently he hasn’t heard of Vanilla Ice.</p><p>As previously reported, Blair owes larceny victim Esther Pilgrim nearly $20,000, but his payments to her stopped coming after his alleged passing. Neither she nor WREG’s hired private investigator were able to locate a death certificate however. In their latest report, WREG spoke to producer Ced-Gee who not only worked with Tim Dog as a member of Ultramagnetic MCs, but produced his biggest hit, 1991’s “Fuck Compton.”</p><p>Read on at <a href=# rel=nofollow>SPIN</a>.</p><p>Photo Credit: Tim Dog/ WREG</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a%2Fs7HSrWSwmaKnrq%2FAjKKqrK2VmXq1tcxmm6ifXZmyorCMn5ybqqWWv7p5kG5ubWxhZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./50-cent-s-diddy-do-it-docuseries-sold-to-netflix-in-bidding-war.html><span>←</span><span>50 Cent's 'Diddy Do It?'
