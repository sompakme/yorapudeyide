In the video, they introduce two representatives from Flexport and Airbnb, who are helping distribute the proceeds raised in the fundraiser.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ryan Peterson, the founder of Flexport, explained the one of the “biggest problems” in humanitarian relief is coordinating when and how to distribute resources. He explains they’ve partnered with an array of aid organizations, including UNICEF and the United Nations, to make it happen.</p><p>“We’re shipping medical supplies,” he said. “All sorts of things like baby wipes and diapers, stuff you wouldn’t imagine that they need out there,” adding the first shipments had left on March 6 th .</p><p>Bryan Chesty of Airbnb then explained how his company would be helping provide housing for up to 100,000 Ukranian refugees. “More than 1 million people in Ukraine have now fled,” he explained. “The big question is where are they going to stay. Well, our host community can actually house them.”</p><p>Airbnb is working with hosts in neighbouring countries, including Germany, Poland, and Hungary, to provide housing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Earlier this week reported that <a href=#>Kutcher and Kunis announced their fundraising initiative</a> last Thursday in a video posted to Kutcher’s Instagram account. In a video, the couple said they would match donations of up to $3 million, though the GoFundMe campaign is hoping to reach at least $30 million. As of publication, the campaign has raised over $18.7 million.</p><p>In the clip, Kunis opened up about being born in the Ukraine before immigrating to the U.S. in childhood. “I came to America in 1991. I have always considered myself an American, a proud American,” she explained. “I love everything that this country has done for myself and my family. But today I have never been more proud to be a Ukrainian.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kutcher and Kunis donated $3 million shortly after the fundraiser passed that mark.
