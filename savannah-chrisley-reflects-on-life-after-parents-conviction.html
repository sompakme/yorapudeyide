I am in the process of finding ME…so bare [sic] with me.”</p><p>Earlier this month, Todd, 53, and Julie, 49, were <a href=#>convicted on charges of tax evasion</a>, bank and wire fraud and conspiracy stemming from a 2019 indictment. Their sentencing is scheduled for October 6.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Savannah-Chrisley-Grateful-Weird-Way-After-Parents-Conviction-003.jpg><p>The duo could each face up to 30 years in prison, but legal excerpt <strong>Jeffrey W. Steinberger</strong> told Us Weekly that he thinks it’s unlikely they’ll receive the maximum sentence. “It’s not a violent crime,” <a href=#>he explained earlier this month</a>. “They can get anywhere up to maybe 10 years, maybe 15 years, or maybe only 5. … From the size of the money, it’s going to be somewhat significant time.”</p><p>The Sassy by Savannah Chrisley founder <a href=#>originally broke her silence</a> about the trial verdict on Thursday, June 16, asking her followers to “please be kind” before sharing their thoughts on her parents’ legal situation. “Recently, I’ve felt let down by God, that my relentless prayers have been unheard,” she wrote via Instagram. “But I do believe that He will use every hardship and adversity we go through to strengthen us and prepare us for an even greater purpose.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In her Wednesday post, however, the reality star said she now believes her family’s ordeal is a “process” that’s teaching her more about herself. “God is slowing me down and working in my heart…it’s a process,” she wrote. “But a process I’m so willing to endure… it’s moments like these that will make me a better daughter, sister, friend, partner, future mother, and daughter of God.”</p><p>After the verdict came in, <a href=#>an insider exclusively told Us</a> that “the entire family is devastated” by the results of the trial.</p><p>“Any future planning in Todd and Julie’s life is pretty much on pause until they learn of the sentencing in the fall,” the source added. “It’s horrible news and they were not expecting to be found guilty. Their whole life changed in that moment.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmaaWu6%2Btx2aaoaqZqLmmxYyrnJ%2BklZjBtHnOp2SloZaaeqKy056pZqiRp7KvwNJmmqimpp6wtbXOp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pardon-the-introduction-50-cent-s-first-lady-lea-is-back-for-the-1st-time.html><span>←</span><span>Pardon The Introduction 50 Cents First Lady Lea Is Back For The 1st Time</span></a>
