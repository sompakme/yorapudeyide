Drizzy&nbsp;captioned the clip, “Me and Jack Harlow blessing the island on behalf of Stake, my fave&nbsp;thing in the world is to try and change someone’s day, week, month, or year.”</p><p>“Alright what’s up? This Drake … I’m with GQ Switzerland’s most attractive man of the Decade, Jack Harlow,” he&nbsp;said in the clip. “And we’re gonna try to bless somebody’s life tonight.”</p><p>The video then cuts to the rappers chatting up&nbsp;Janardo Laporte, an entertainer at the Grace Bay Club. Drake praises Laporte for his rendition of his 2013 gut&nbsp;Just Hold On We’re Going Home, which the Certified Lover Boy&nbsp;confesses made him feel “a little self-conscious.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“It’s better than the OG, I’m not gonna lie,”</a> he added.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Britney Spears & Caitlyn Jenner Both Interested In Buying Drake’s $14.1M ‘YOLO Estate’</a></span></p><p>The Champagne Papi pulled up a game of roulette on Stake, the crypto betting platform that he partnered with earlier this year, and the three of them enjoyed a few spins before Drake asks Laporte, “if you get money tonight, what’s the most important thing what are you going to use it for, what’s the goal right now?”</p><p>The musician revealed that he has three kids and that he would love&nbsp;to do something for them. Laporte&nbsp;also revealed&nbsp;that any cash he received would help him to&nbsp;enhance his music career. The God’s Plan singer generously gifts the man $20,000 and says “on behalf of me and Jack, here’s 20 grand.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Hey, I wasn’t expecting this,” a surprised Laporte said to the camera. “I was on my way home, and oh man! Yeah, baby!”</p><p>Drake, <a href=#>who is worth roughly $200 million</a>, has something of&nbsp;a reputation for surprising fans with cash. The rapper shocked some of his fellow Canadians recently when he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">handed out stacks of cash from the back of his Mercedes-Benz Maybach in Toronto.</a></p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>6ix9ine Is 'Struggling to Make Ends Meet' After Failed Comeback</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">UPROXX</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxs63KnmSappRit6KvymafmqqcpMRuv9Srp6uho5p6p63NZqSoppWufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brighten-and-tighten-tired-eyes-with-this-peach-lily-favorite.html><span>←</span><span>Brighten and Tighten Tired Eyes With This Peach &amp;amp; Lily Favorite</span></a>
