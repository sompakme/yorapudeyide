It’s unclear how the agreement divides the couple’s assets or what they’re entitled to amid the divorce, if anything. But the insider added, “[Kaley’s] assets are protected.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears' Boyfriend Sam Asghari Spotted Shopping Diamonds At Cartier</a></span></p><p>Active in the entertainment industry since her teenage, Kaley has amassed a net worth of approximately $100 million. She rose to fame thanks to recurring roles on shows like 8 Simple Rules (2002-2005) and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Big Bang Theory </a>(2007-2019) and has since starred in successful projects like HBO’s The Flight Attendant, for which she was an executive producer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Conversely, Karl isn’t in the entertainment industry. Rather, he’s an award-winning equestrian; the former couple initially bonded over their love of horses. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan </a>reports, Karl is also the son of billionaire businessman Scott D. Cook, who’s best known for founding Intuit. He’s also the director at eBay and Procter & Gamble.</p><p>Kaley and Karl have been married for a little over three years. They originally married in June 2018 after getting engaged the last year in November. They tied the knot in a rustic-themed ceremony at Pomponio Ranch in San Mateo County, California.</p><p>The couple went on to announce their separation on September 3, 2021, and Kaley filed for divorce the same day. In a statement released to the media, the pair emphasized they still have a “deep love and respect for one another,” but said their lives are going in “opposite directions.”</p><p>Kaley and Karl ended their joint statement by asking for privacy during the difficult time. They added they feel no “anger or animosity” towards each other despite their break-up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kaley previously had an expensive divorce from professional tennis player <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Sweeting</a>. The pair got engaged in September 2013 after three years of dating and tied the knot that December. Kaley later announced on September 15 they were separating, and their divorce was finalized in May.</p><p>However, Kaley was ordered to pay her ex-husband $165,000 in the divorce settlement in addition to $55,000 in legal fees, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight </a>reports. She also had to fork over $195,000 to her ex’s personal trainers. Kaley and Ryan had signed a prenuptial agreement prior to their marriage, so any money she made during her time on Big Bang Theory was protected amid the divorce.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daddy Hadid Is Building A Controversial $250M Mega Mansion</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Nova</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4orjEsmScrZ%2BYvLR5w6KtqKqTmnqnvs6mZJuhnKG2sLrAoqmeZZuWv615wqimpGWgp7y1scKtnJ1lkq56qr7Op2ScpJGZerG%2BxKesqWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jerry-lawler-terry-funk-announced-for-an-empty-arena-retrospective-at-starrcast-ii.html><span>←</span><span>Jerry Lawler &amp;amp; Terry Funk Announced For An Empty Arena Retrospective At Starrcast II</span></a>
