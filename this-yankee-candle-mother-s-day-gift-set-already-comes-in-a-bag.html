We love to celebrate Mother’s Day, but shopping for a gift is a whole different issue. Moms can be picky! We can’t say we blame them, though. That’s why we’re hoping to help everyone out who might need some guidance on gift-giving! Feel like just one gift isn’t enough to show Mom love?"><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

We receive compensation when you click on a link and make a purchase. <a href=# rel>Learn more!</a></p><p>We love to celebrate Mother’s Day, but shopping for a <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> is a whole different issue. Moms can be picky! We can’t say we blame them, though. That’s why we’re hoping to help everyone out who might need some guidance on gift-giving! Feel like just one gift isn’t enough to show Mom love? This set has four – five if you count the tote bag, which we do!</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yankee Candle Mother’s Day Candle Lover’s Tote</a> is the ultimate Mother’s Day gift. It also works perfectly as a birthday gift, a thank you gift, a get well gift, a “just because” gift or a gift to ourselves just for being awesome! Treating ourselves is a way of life, but it feels even better when we’re getting such an amazing deal! We can get this bag stuffed with over $100 worth of goodies for just $40 by spending $20 for a limited time! So we think we may just gift ourselves a candle, too!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Candles-1.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mother’s Day Candle Lover’s Tote</a> ($100 value) for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$40</a> when you make a $20 purchase at Yankee Candle!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This four-piece candle gift set comes in a sparkly blue-grey tote with complementary floral handles. We don’t even need to wrap it! The best part is that, even when Mom takes out the candles inside, she’ll still be left with a pretty tote to use as an everyday or even special occasion bag!</p><p>Inside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this bag</a> are four different kinds of candles. Different scents, yes, but different types of jars and wicks, too! In the large classic jar, we’ll find the Fresh Cut Roses candle, which is inspired by an “intoxicating English garden of fragrant heirloom roses.” How’s that to help Mom feel fancy? Gifting an actual bouquet of roses is nice, but this candle will last longer!</p><p>The second candle inside is a Magnolia & Lily large two-wick square candle. Can’t choose between floral and citrus scents? We don’t have to! This candle mixes the fragrance of magnolia with citrus for a unique scent that will have us reaching for a match as soon as we get home!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mothers-Day-Set.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mother’s Day Candle Lover’s Tote</a> ($100 value) for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$40</a> when you make a $20 purchase at Yankee Candle!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The third candle inside is a medium WoodWick hourglass candle in Coastal Sunset. Wooden wicks are game changers when it comes to candles. When lit, they make a relaxing crackling sound, and since this specific wick is super wide, the flame looks extra gorgeous. It’s a conversation-starter, and the scent of blossoms, coconut and salty ocean air will make anyone feel like they’re on an endless vacation!</p><p>The last candle making up this ever-so-perfect gift set is a medium Chesapeake Bay Candle in the Serenity & Calm scent. We love the style of the frosted jar look of the Chesapeake Bay candles. They feel calming even before we light them! This specific candle, meant to soothe both mind and body through aromatherapy, is a blend of lavender and thyme, with notes of orange blossom, bergamot, rosemary and patchouli. Light it up and lie back! This candle is ideal for relaxation. Just try not to fall asleep while it’s lit!</p><p>This may be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the easiest Mother’s Day gift ever</a> at the best value, but it still contains so much thought behind it. Each candle has its own benefits, and we’re sure that our mom will love them all. She’s going to be bragging about what a great gift it was when people around town start complimenting her on her cute new tote, too!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mother’s Day Candle Lover’s Tote</a> ($100 value) for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$40</a> when you make a $20 purchase at Yankee Candle!&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Not your mom’s style?
