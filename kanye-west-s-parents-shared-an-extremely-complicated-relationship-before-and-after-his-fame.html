In a social media post inspired by that subject, West revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his parents' divorce ruined his relationship with his father</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who are Kanye West and Kim Kardashian's kids</a>, according to People?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Child's Name:</p></th><th scope=col><p>When They Were Born:</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>North West</p></td><td><p>June 15, 2013</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Saint West</p></td><td><p>December 5, 2015</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Chicago West</p></td><td><p>January 15, 2018</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Psalm West</p></td><td><p>May 9, 2019</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In February 2022, West was angry that Kardashian allowed their kids to appear on TikTok.

Putting aside West's feelings about his kids being on TikTok, the rapper argued that he was fighting for parents who feel cut out of the decision-making about their kids.</p><p>To back up West's claim that he was sticking up for other divorced parents, he brought up his own childhood in an Instagram post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kanye-west-and-his-mom-donda-west-before-her-passing.jpg><p>“MY DAD DIDN’T HAVE MONEY OR A PUBLIC VOICE WHEN MY MOM DESTROYED ME AND HIS RELATIONSHIP.

She raised the musician in Chicago as a single mother after she and ex-husband Ray separated when West was 3 years old. As West's music career grew, his mother decided to retire from her position at Chicago State University and moved to Los Angeles so she could become his full-time 'momager' from 2004."</p><p>On top of Donda West's career, West's mom also tried to move on following her divorce by remarrying. In 2016, Donda West's ex-husband Willie Scott spoke to The Daily Mail and stated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">West's jealousy came between his marriage</a>.</p><p>"Kanye didn't want me with his mother or any man for that matter.
