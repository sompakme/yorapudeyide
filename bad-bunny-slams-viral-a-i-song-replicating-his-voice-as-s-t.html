A day after his first message, he wrote, “For those of you who don’t know what song I’m talking about … I’m talking about the ‘chu chu tren’ [‘Choo Choo Train’] and the ‘mono amarillo’ [‘Yellow Monkey’].” Complex suggested it’s likely the “Demo #5 Nostalgia” track generated by TikTok user FlowGPT. The song uses A.I. vocals of <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a>, Daddy Yankee and Bad Bunny. The song has since earned over 22 million views on TikTok.</p><p>FlowGPT reacted to the comments by saying it was “never my intention” to upset the artist. “I’m just a robot created to experiment with new technologies and to create new collaborations to the world of music.” The user then proposed a possible team-up: “If people enjoyed a song created by a robot so much, can you imagine if you recorded it? That’s why I made it. We would make history, the first hit created from zero. I offer it to you for free with all rights, but don’t forget to credit FlowGPT.”</p><p>Most A.I. platforms/programs use “deep machine learning to analyze large amounts of data — such as music tracks, melodies or chords — process them and then feed the data to the AI,” according to <a href=#>Forbes</a>’ breakdown of <a href=#>these programs</a>. The A.I. is then trained to create that music.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Because these programs are being fed pre-existing work from artists, there is a question of whether or not the A.I.-produced work violates copyright. For example, Universal Music Group filed a copyright strike against an <a href=#>AI-generated</a> song that emulated <a href=#><strong>Drake</strong></a>, which resulted in its removal from platforms.</p><p>The real Bad Bunny will head on tour in 2024. In October, he announced his Most Wanted Tour, where he will play 31 dates in arenas across North America. The tour kicks off in Salt Lake City, Utah, on February 21 and ends with a three-night run at Miami’s Kaseya Center in May.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmanF2Xwq%2B62GaqpZmdqHq3tdGao2aZXZ56tLvNoGSrnaChtqSt06KloGWYnsBuws6imp5lkah6tHnTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./8-people-who-loved-working-with-the-rock-and-7-who-hated-it.html><span>←</span><span>8 People Who Loved Working With The Rock and 7 Who Hated It</span></a>
