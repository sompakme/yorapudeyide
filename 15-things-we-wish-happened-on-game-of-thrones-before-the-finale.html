The eighth season left a lot of fans feeling disappointed with the outcome of the story, and also prompted them to develop <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fan theories that seemed more interesting than what we saw on the show</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the show has finally come to a close, fans have come up with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">alternative ways that the series should have ended</a>, as well as pondering alternate backgrounds of their favorite characters that they feel are more satisfying that what HBO gave us. The influx of theories has made us realize that there are so many things we wish happened on Game of Thrones before the finale. Keep reading to find out what they are.</p><h2 id=arya-stark-fulfils-her-prophecy><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Arya Stark Fulfils Her Prophecy</span></h2><p>Arya Stark, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">played by Maisie Williams who enjoyed her time on the hit show</a>, was predicted to shut brown eyes, blue eyes, and green eyes after becoming an assassin. Fans believed that she would kill Cersei Lannister and shut the evil queen’s green eyes, but as we know, Cersei died from bricks falling on her. While some fans believe that her execution of Littlefinger fulfilled this prophecy, most would have loved to watch Arya kill Cersei.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jaime-lannister-kills-cersei><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Jaime Lannister Kills Cersei</span></h2><p>If Arya wasn’t the one to kill Cersei, then fans wanted it to be Jaime. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most fans were convinced that Jamie was definitely going to kill his sister</a>&nbsp;since it would have been the most poetic ending to their super toxic relationship. But no. Cersei was killed by bricks.</p><h2 id=meera-reed-returns-to-the-story><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Meera Reed Returns To The Story</span></h2><p>Before the final season aired, many fans were asking if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meera Reed was going to return</a>, possibly appearing beyond the Wall. Sadly, we never got to find out what became of Meera, and considering how significant she was in helping Bran along on his journey, this seems kind of unfair.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 TV Shows To Watch If You Still Miss Game Of Thrones</a></span></p><h2 id=jon-and-daenerys-have-a-baby><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Jon And Daenerys Have A Baby</span></h2><p>With hints that Daenerys could be pregnant, fans were hoping to see her and Jon Snow have a baby together in Season Eight. Of course, in true Game of Thrones&nbsp;style, their relationship came to a tragic end. After finding out they were related, Daenerys descended into madness and Jon stabbed her to death.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bran-is-revealed-as-the-night-king><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Bran Is Revealed As The Night King</span></h2><p>A lot of fans were unhappy with Bran’s ending in the finale of Season Eight. Despite not contributing much to any of the final battles, Bran ended up being given the Iron Throne. Fans were hoping something a little more interesting would happened to his character, such as the revelation that he was really the Night King.</p><h2 id=melisandre-s-background-is-fully-explained><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Melisandre’s Background Is Fully Explained</span></h2><p>Melisandre was no regular woman in Westeros, but many fans are still confused as to exactly what she is and what powers she has. It’s clear that she’s secretly much older than she appears to be, and seemed to lose her youth whenever she took off her necklace, but we were never told the exact story behind this.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Game Of Thrones Fan Theories We Still Wish Were True</a></span></p><h2 id=jaqen-h-ghar-returns-to-the-story><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jaqen H’ghar Returns To The Story</span></h2><p>Jaqen H’ghar was one of the most interesting and mysterious characters to appear on Game of Thrones, and he was also one of the most crucial players in Arya’s story. Fans couldn’t get enough of him from the second he appeared on the screen, and many were hoping that he would return for the final season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=we-learn-the-fate-of-the-night-s-watch><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>We Learn The Fate Of The Night’s Watch</span></h2><p>We know that Jon decided to venture beyond the Wall and live amongst the wildlings, as his heart always longed for. But by the end of the finale, we never learned what happened to the rest of the Night’s Watch. With no Night King, it seems there was no longer a need for the Night’s Watch. It would have been great to have this cleared up!</p><h2 id=daenerys-becomes-the-night-queen><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Daenerys Becomes The Night Queen</span></h2><p>Many fans are less than satisfied with the way Daenerys’s story came to an end. Even if she couldn’t sit on the Iron Throne, we still would have liked to see her end in a more epic way than being quietly stabbed by her lover. It would have been so moving to see her become the new Night Queen.</p><h2 id=missandei-and-grey-worm-get-more-time-together><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Missandei And Grey Worm&nbsp;Get More Time Together</span></h2><p>Very few couples in Game of Thrones&nbsp;get to live happily ever after. Missandei and Grey Worm were one of our favorite couples so we wish they had more time together before Missandei was eventually captured and beheaded by Cersei. The former slaves both had such hard lives prior to finding each other that they deserved more time together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Major Mistakes You Missed In Game Of Thrones (From Season 1 To 8)</a></span></p><h2 id=cersei-gets-her-elephants><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Cersei Gets Her Elephants</span></h2><p>Several plotlines and promises were left unanswered in the final season of Game of Thrones. The Golden Company was shown promising Cersei her elephants but she was never given these elephants. Whether their absence was due to time constraints or budgeting issues is irrelevant. We really wanted to see some elephants!</p><h2 id=we-learn-the-significance-of-the-white-walker-signs><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>We Learn The Significance Of The White Walker Signs</span></h2><p>Fans of the show were pondering the meaning of the signs the wights left behind since the pilot episode of the first season. It was disappointing (and that’s an understatement) to never learn what the wights meant by these signs or if they had any significance at all. At the very least, they should have been explained, perhaps by the all-knowing Bran.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=we-find-out-if-any-character-was-the-prince-that-was-promised><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>We Find Out If Any Character Was The Prince That Was Promised</span></h2><p>Another fan theory that viewers believed might come to fruition in the final season was the revelation that one of the main characters, either Jon Snow or Arya Stark, was the reincarnation of Azor Ahai, the Prince That Was Promised to save the world. We never found out if any of the characters, who were respectively resurrected from the dead and responsible for killing the Night King, were reincarnated.</p><h2 id=drogon-finds-another-dragon-and-has-dragon-babies><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Drogon Finds Another Dragon And Has Dragon Babies</span></h2><p>Drogon, Daenerys’s favorite dragon, survived the story but had to endure a lot of suffering. He saw both his brothers die as well as his mother. Fans would have loved to know where he carried Daenerys’s body off to and see him have a happy ending, maybe by finding another dragon and having dragon babies.</p><h2 id=jon-at-least-sits-on-the-iron-throne-before-giving-it-up><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jon At Least Sits On The Iron Throne (Before Giving It Up)</span></h2><p>Given all that Jon Snow went through from the beginning of the story to the end, and given his lineage as the son of Rhaegar Targaryen, most fans would have chosen to see him sit on the Iron Throne. Knowing Jon, he would have refused it not long after taking it, but it would have been amazing to see him sit on it, at least once.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Photos Of Jon Snow's Relationship Timeline On Game Of Thrones</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiemqWVYrynedOhqaimlah6uLTArWSwnV2strS0jKGYqaiVo7KlecGenaiqlWKzqrrApZxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danielle-bregoli-looks-like-she-lost-a-fight-against-woah-vicky.html><span>←</span><span> Danielle Bregoli Looks Like She Lost a Fight Against Woah Vicky</span></a>
