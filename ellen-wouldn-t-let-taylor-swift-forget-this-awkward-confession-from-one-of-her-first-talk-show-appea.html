Let's... I'm going to give you a chance to clear it up. When you have spare time, you drive past your ex-boyfriends' houses. Why?"</p><p>Taylor replied, "I don't do that," while looking down and smiling. Ellen retorted, "Yes you do!" as Taylor elaborated on why Ellen thought that about her; she confessed it on MySpace.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ellen-show-zac-efron-and-taylor-swift-.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Zac Efron And Taylor Swift Exposed Ellen On Her Own Show Years Ago">Zac Efron And Taylor Swift Exposed Ellen On Her Own Show Years Ago</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>During the interview, Zac and Taylor decided to sing a song, which basically dissed Ellen for her interview skills.</p><p>Swift noted that she put that on her MySpace, but that "My MySpace is not like the typical Taylor Swift is blah blah blah so I wrote this bio on MySpace and it's actually — it's very honest about who I am as a person. I'm like 'in my free time I like to drive past my ex-boyfriends' houses."</p><p>Taylor mimicked typing as she explained that she's not "like throwing eggs," just "checking up on them."</p><p>Both the audience and Ellen seemed amused at that point, but Ellen also took the MySpace confession quite seriously. She teased Taylor, who called it an "act of public service" that she checked up on her exes.</p><p>Taylor finally ended the line of questioning by declaring, "Everybody does that, it's just nobody admits to it."</p><p>Ellen might have given up at that point, but she would bring up the drive-by tidbit in future interviews, never letting Taylor forget about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ellen-wouldn-39-t-let-taylor-forget-her-stalker-ish-confession>Ellen Wouldn't Let Taylor Forget Her Stalker-Ish Confession</h2><h3 id=on-another-episode-of-ellen-taylor-swift-was-reminded-of-her-bad-habit>On another episode of Ellen, Taylor Swift was reminded of her bad habit</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-was-completely-caught-off-guard-after-ellen-brought-out-her-secret-music-crush.jpg><p>As uncomfortable as her second interview might have been with Ellen, Taylor Swift returned many more times throughout the talk show host's run. Later in 2008, Taylor sat on Ellen's stage and admitted that Joe Jonas had dumped her during a brief phone call.</p><p>At the time, Taylor was promoting her album Fearless and admitted there was one song on the album about her most recent ex. Ellen brought up the drive-by factoid again during this interview while asking Swift whether she planned to drive by Jonas' house.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/was-sophie-turner-friends-with-taylor-swift-before-the-joe-jonas-divorce-scandal_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Was Sophie Turner Friends With Taylor Swift Before The Joe Jonas Divorce Scandal?">Was Sophie Turner Friends With Taylor Swift Before The Joe Jonas Divorce Scandal?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Now that Sophie Turner is getting divorced from Joe Jonas, fans want to know the real story behind her friendship with Taylor Swift.</p><p>When Ellen asked if that was going to happen with this ex, Taylor looked away before looking down. She raised her hands as if she was going to cover her face, then paused and said, "He's got a lot of security guards... they're big... so probably not."</p><p>Ellen then dropped the subject and instead asked Taylor about her other method of healing post-breakup: her <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a>. The interview concluded without any more mention of Taylor's old embarrassing moment, but other interviews didn't go quite as smoothly.</p><h2 id=ellen-degeneres-sometimes-charms-taylor-and-sometimes-drags-her>Ellen DeGeneres Sometimes Charms Taylor (And Sometimes Drags Her)</h2><h3 id=taylor-swift-has-appeared-on-ellen-many-times-but-not-every-appearance-goes-well>Taylor Swift has appeared on Ellen many times, but not every appearance goes well</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/taylor-swift-on-the-ellen-degeneres-show.jpg><p>During some of Taylor's appearances on Ellen, the singer seemed to feel comfortable and respected.

Fans may have had more to say about her appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show than she did though.</p><p>It was widely interpreted as Ellen dragging Taylor when the talk show host tried to get Swift to confirm (by ringing a bell) which men she actually dated out of a pool of rumored beaus. Taylor flat-out told Ellen that she wasn't feeling very good about herself, and also defended herself when Ellen seemed to hint that Taylor was lying about not having dated Zac Efron.</p><p>While some fans are still unsure whether Taylor might have dated Zac on the down-low, Taylor wasn't having it when it came to Ellen inquiring about her love life. Even during a joking interview, Taylor's dating life was brought up once again as Ellen gave her fill-in-the-blank prompts like "I'm Taylor Swift and the last person I kissed was —."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet Taylor continued to appear on Ellen, perhaps suggesting that she and DeGeneres are friendlier than some of her on-stage appearances may suggest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpaSVo3qmucGaqauZo6iypXnTmrClp6JiwLi1xa1kna2inruoecinq56qpp6yuHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deborah-hung-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Deborah Hung Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
