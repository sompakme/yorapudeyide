But I feel like I invented temporary Halloween,” he told the <a href=#>Seattle Times</a> in October 2000, pointing to fake blood as one example where his store had cornered the market. “[We have] the fake blood that coagulates, the thin runny blood, the semi-thick blood and the one that just lays there like a slug,” the CEO explained.</p><p>Keep scrolling for everything to know about Spirit Halloween.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bovaq%2ByK1koZmcoby4scSnZKKrXZeypLvMoqWgZZFiurDCyJ5knq6Vp8a1tMinnmasn2K4r7vWaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-was-hollywood-producer-harvey-weinstein-arrested-his-sexual-assault-charges-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Why Was Hollywood Producer Harvey Weinstein Arrested?
