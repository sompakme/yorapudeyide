Without a doubt, the cast enjoyed working on the show and adore their co-workers. Jaren Lewison and Maitreyi Ramakrishnan are total besties these days, as evidenced by their Instagram posts. So, what exactly has the cast said about Never Have I Ever? Let's find out.</p><h2 id=darren-barnett-is-impressed-by-maitreyi-ramakrishnan><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Darren Barnett Is Impressed By Maitreyi Ramakrishnan</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a chat with Elle magazine, Darren Barnett, who plays one of Ramakrishnan's love interests on the show, and who is more than a decade older than her, said that Ramakrishnan "is like a prodigy of some sort. Like, you think about this girl who just came out of high school. She's leading in a major show. She's there working 12 to 14 hours every single day. And she's never done anything like this."</p><h2 id=jaren-lewison-said-he-and-maitreyi-will-be-friends-for-life><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jaren Lewison Said He And Maitreyi Will Be Friends For Life</span></h2><p>As Jaren Lewison and Ramakrishnan were both recent high school grads upon being hired for Never Have I Ever, they quickly became best friends. It is worth noting that the two are also new to the entertainment industry. "I have no doubt that if there's anyone in my life that can change the world through this business, I've really put my money on [Ramakrishnan]. I have no doubt that her and I are going to be friends for life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Fans Really Feel About Never Have I Ever</a></span></p><h2 id=never-have-i-ever-was-ramakrishnan-39-s-first-role><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Never Have I Ever Was Ramakrishnan's First Role</span></h2><p>"No matter what project I get next - it could be the coolest project, it could be my dream role of Rapunzel. But it'll never be the first exactly. It's like your first dog. It doesn't mean I'll love the other dogs less. But Never Have I Ever will always be the first one." She also went on to say she didn't really know what she was doing in the first season. "Sometimes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when I see clips from season 1, I cringe so hard.</a> I'm watching this girl's face and I'm like, 'You have no idea what the sh*t you're doing. You are just going with it. You are faking it 'til you make it right now.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=poorna-jagannathan-says-everyone-is-a-teenybopper-when-they-watch-never-have-i-ever><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Poorna Jagannathan Says Everyone Is A Teenybopper When They Watch Never Have I Ever</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"We're all teenyboppers when we watch the show,"</a> Poorna Jagannathan said to Vogue. She plays the role of the main character's mom on the show. "It's our childhood experiences on a screen, and they hold the key to so much of who we are as adults," she continued. The show does appeal to a wide range of audiences. No matter what age you are, Never Have I Ever is very relatable and funny.</p><h2 id=good-representation-means-hard-work-to-poorna-jagannathan><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Good Representation Means Hard Work To Poorna Jagannathan</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In her interview with Vogue, Jagannathan said that good representation to her means "hard work." She added that "Never Have I Ever worked because someone put in the work and didn't take those shortcuts of going to familiar faces and people they already knew. For diversity to work, there needs to be an ecosystem of diversity feeding it."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Fans Think Ben On Never Have I Ever Is Based On B.J.

So it's really awesome to see brown guys get some love and be put in that handsome light."</p><h2 id=ramakrishnan-praised-the-writing-on-never-have-i-ever><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ramakrishnan Praised The Writing On Never Have I Ever</span></h2><p>In an interview with Variety, Ramakrishnan said that "it's such a standout show, because it's of course really funny, and has all these quick-witted moments. The writing is super smart, super poignant, every line matters. Every character is so unique and provides something to the story, and it's very heart-warming. Real things are being spoken about in a way that it's natural, it's organic, it's relatable, and that's why many people, not just young South Asian brown girls can relate to it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jaren-loved-the-hospital-scene-with-darren><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jaren Loved The Hospital Scene With Darren</span></h2><p>In an interview with Variety, Jaren Lewison who plays Ben said that his hospital scene with Darren was something he loved because the scene "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">focused on vulnerability from both of those men</a>, which I think it awesome. Because you are watching a scene with two people who are very different from each other and are going through different life stressors like Ben is really stressed out, and Paxton is in a different way, and I think to watch them open up to each other and to watch that male bonding and that male vulnerability is really important and I hope that it would inspire some difficult conversations from high schoolers that are watching the show."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsGpsYycmKysXaSzbrrEr5yrZZiWw6Z5yGacr52iYrWiv4ysmKKcXZavsMHTZquhnV2otbDDjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-wanted-s-tom-parker-christina-aguilera-is-a-total-bitch.html><span>←</span><span>The Wanted's Tom Parker: Christina Aguilera &amp;quot;Is a Total Bitch&amp;quot;</span></a>
