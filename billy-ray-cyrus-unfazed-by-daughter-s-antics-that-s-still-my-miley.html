I come for that school of as a singer/songwriter, as a musician, that it starts with a song,” he told Piers. “And it’s that magic moment when a song finds the right artist, the right singer, and it becomes a synchronicity of that moment in time. Miley harnessed into something very special. She’s just Miley. She’s an artist, she’s real. I think that’s what’s happened over the years, Miley has been reinventing her sound. She’s evolving as an artist herself. I think that it’s all of what everyone is calling controversy now.
