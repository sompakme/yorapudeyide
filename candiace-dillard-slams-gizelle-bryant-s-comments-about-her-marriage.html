Speculation arose about their relationship last month after a woman came forward claiming to be Chris’ mistress, alleging that she had an abortion at his request.</p><p class=p1>Candiace’s <i>RHOP </i>costar <a href=#><strong>Gizelle Bryant</strong> </a>subsequently told <i>Us </i>that the woman’s story was “very believable.”</p><p class=p1>“I feel like it’s unfortunate, but<a href=#> I tried to tell Candiace about her husband</a> last season,” Gizelle, 53, exclusively said<i> </i>last month. “And she didn’t want to listen [to me], so maybe she should have listened.”</p><p class=p1>As BravoCon kicked off on Friday, Candiace shut down Gizelle’s remarks.</p><p class=p1>“She thinks that’s a little believable or she supports her friend in not believing that <a href=#><strong>Juan [Dixon]</strong> </a>had sex with a woman allegedly at a hotel. I’m sorry,” Candiace quipped to <i>Us</i> at the Las Vegas convention, referring to <a href=#><strong>Robyn Dixon</strong>’s husband</a>. “No matter how hard a miserable, sad troll with a long neck may try to infiltrate a happy marriage, she just won’t succeed. And that’s all she wrote.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RHOP-s-Candiace-Dillard-Says-Gizelle-Bryant-Won-t-Infiltrate-Her-Marriage-With-Split-Rumors-195.jpg><p class=p1>Candiace’s pal and fellow <i>RHOP </i>personality <a href=#><strong>Wendy Osefo</strong> </a>chimed in and noted that Gizelle’s thoughts are probably a result of her own experiences.</p><p class=p1>“I think that people’s response is often rooted in the pain, the trauma that they’ve experienced in their life,” Wendy, 39, told <i>Us</i> on Friday. “So if you think that that’s believable, I think that that says more about you than the rumor itself.”</p><p class=p1>After Candiace cosigned Wendy’s argument, she opened up to <i>Us </i>about whether <a href=#>a reconciliation is in the cards</a> for her and Gizelle.</p><p class=p1>“Why? Would you want to be friends with someone who <a href=#>accused your husband of sexual assault</a> and then drove the nail in even more by doubling down on and perhaps being a part of rumors to tear him down yet again?” Candiace said. “No, no, no, thank you. Good night.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RHOP-s-Candiace-Dillard-Says-Gizelle-Bryant-Won-t-Infiltrate-Her-Marriage-With-Split-Rumors-194.jpg><p class=p1>Gizelle had previously alleged that Chris came onto her after the <a href=#><i>RHOP </i>season 6 reunion</a>, which both Chris and Candiace have denied.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Gizelle is very flirty with Chris and Chris flirts back with Gizelle and this happens in front of me,” Candiace claimed during an episode of the <a href=# rel=noopener>“Reality With the King” </a>podcast in October 2022. “It has never given me pause or made me feel threatened in any kind of way because Chris does not want Gizelle’s 50-year-old p—sy.
