However, he has stated that he is “open to whatever impulses that may occur inside me at any time.”</p><p>Andrew has previously said that he was solely sexually attracted to women. On the other hand, his life philosophy is always to attempt to yield to the wonder of not being in command.</p><p>Garfield believes that most people attempt to control and govern his experience by erecting barriers around what he is and who he is. He wants to know as much as he can about the truth before he dies.</p><p>Andrew is receptive to whatever impulses emerge in him at any given time. But, if the actor had to identify, he’d say he’s heterosexual and someone who identifies that way and is playing such an important role.</p><p>The media momentarily chastised Garfield in July 2017 after claiming to be “a gay man without the physical act.” Like many others used to either criticize or investigate celebrities’ personal lives, he took the comment out of context.</p><p>It came out of a semi-public debate about Andrew’s preparation in London, which included a lot of RuPaul’s Drag Race viewing.</p><p>Garfield believes he has a general thirst for investigation and a purpose of penetrating the psyche of a completely identifying homosexual man.</p><p>Not just that, Garfield said, “he think part of what he was trying to say was about inclusion, and about that openness to his impulses.” Also, he thinks Drag Race might be the best-ever show he has ever seen on television.</p><p>In 2014, Arcade Fire frontman Win Butler responded to criticism from his gay-rights anthem “We Exist,” starring Andrew Garfield as a transgender woman who finds peace while rocking out on stage with the band at Coachella.</p><p>“We Exist” music director David Wilson proclaimed that he contemplated casting Garfield due to his enthusiasm for the project. Similarly, the song is about a kid attempting to inform his father that he is gay.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-andrew-garfield-married-or-dating></span>Is Andrew Garfield Married Or Dating?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Andrew Garfield is not married yet. The reason behind why is he is single to date is his passion for acting.
