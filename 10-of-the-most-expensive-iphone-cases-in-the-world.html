A $5 case from Walmart will do the trick, but others like to splurge on cases with designs and rhinestones, or maybe a $60 Otterbox to keep their phone as safe as possible. For the richest of the rich, however, an even fancier case might be called for. Cases made out of precious metals, embedded with real jewels, or handcrafted from butter-soft leather don't come cheap, but it's all worth it to some iPhone owners. Take a look at 10 of the most expensive iPhone cases in the world:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-swarovski-crystal-covered-case>10) Swarovski Crystal-Covered Case</h2><p>This isn't the most expensive iPhone case out there, but it just might be the gaudiest. For $239, your phone can be blinged out in this plastic shell covered in tiny hand-glued Swarovski crystals. Not only is it shrouded in crystals, but there's also carefully attached details like bows, gold roses and even a tiny teddy bear. The case even comes with extra crystals in the event that any come loose. The handcrafted accessory is available on Etsy and has been given an average of five out of five stars by customers. We can only assume&nbsp;that everyone in the vicinity is blinded when this sparkling monstrosity comes out of their pocket to answer a text.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-louis-vuitton-case>9) Louis Vuitton Case</h2><p>via louisvuitton.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Louis Vuitton is one of the most recognized name in handbags and shoes, but they've also squeezed themselves into other accessory niches like sunglasses and jewelry. So why not iPhone cases, too? Back when the actual Louis Vuitton founded his fashion house in 1854, he had no idea the brand would span to things like iPhone covers (he had no idea what a cell phone even was, either), but we're pretty sure he'd approve of this classic design. For $330, the case features the iconic Louis Vuitton logo stamped across cowhide leather. The inside is lined with microfiber to protect the iPhone from scratches. The only downside to this case is that it's more like a sleeve that you have to slide your phone out of to actually use it, which isn't the most practical solution for everyday iPhone users.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-gucci-crocodile-case>8) Gucci Crocodile&nbsp;Case</h2><p>via emenaccesories.com</p><p>Gucci carries a phone case similar to that of Louis Vuitton with the slip-in, slip-out style. While Louis Vuitton's is made of regular cowhide leather, Gucci's is made from alligator skin. Besides being fancier and more expensive, alligator hide is thought to be more weather resistant than that from a cow. Protection is certainly a big factor for most people who are shopping for a phone case, but at $495, alligator is obviously a pricey option. When your iPhone case costs more than your actual iPhone, you know you can afford to replace a broken cell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-dolce-amp-gabbana-case>7) Dolce & Gabbana Case</h2><p>via:www.moski.si</p><p>Dolce & Gabbana kept with Gucci's alligator case trend, but made it even more extravagant as a wallet-style case, with a gold chain strap. For $595, you get a black leather case embossed with your choice of bronze or silver colored alligator skin. The case has a soft fabric lining, a 47 inch chain cross-body strap, and separate compartments for the iPhone itself and sleeves to hold your money and credit cards - which if you can afford this case, your probably have a lot of.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-titanium-bumper-case-from-gresso>6) Titanium Bumper Case from Gresso</h2><p>via luxuo.com</p><p>Gresso's line of classy, masculine cases range from $1000 to $10,000, and are handcrafted from solid titanium. The back of the case is covered in your choice of Italian leather or alligator hide, and then completed with a solid gold version of Gresso's logo. Gresso says the titanium parts of each case are hand polished for four hours before they're ready to be sold to consumers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-the-tower-flower-case>5) The Tower Flower Case</h2><p>via diyouth.com</p><p>This hand-decorated plastic case featured on the craft-selling website Etsy, features a sparkling gold Eiffel tower surrounded by pearly white flowers and gems. Regular women might pay $30 for a case as pretty (and as similar) as this one, but the seller has an asking price of $1495 per case. But if you have millions to blow, why not spend it on decorating your iPhone?&nbsp;Then, your phone will be ready&nbsp;for a first class flight to the actual Eiffel tower in Paris.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-the-case-mate-case>4) The Case-Mate Case</h2><p>via carphonewarehouse.ie</p><p>This case also leaves us scratching our heads as to exactly why the price tag is so darn high. The plain white case is made of a hard plastic shell with a silicone lining. It boasts SoundscoopTM technology that redirects sound from your iPhone's speaker outwards instead of down. Besides that, the only unique thing about this case is your ability to customize it. All that white space can be filled with photos or designs of your choice. Just upload them to the Case-Mate website, and the custom phone will appear at your doorstep - for $4271.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-titanium-case-from-brikk>3) Titanium Case from Brikk</h2><p>via:www.betcheslovethis.com</p><p>This phone case is made from solid titanium in your choice of "gray stealth," "platinum," "gold," or "black carbon" colors. There's no attachments or embellishments besides the brand, "Brikk" etched subtlety on the top of the case. This $4430 case is possibly the sleekest you can buy. Plus, the titanium shell has practical protection capabilities. There's no way your phone can get scratched or bent out of shape in this case.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-miansai-14-carat-gold-case>2) Miansai 14 Carat Gold Case</h2><p>via supercompressor.com</p><p>For $10,000, your phone can be covered in solid 14-carat gold. There really is no practical purpose to this case, because as an owner, you would be way more concerned about this case becoming damaged than your actual iPhone, which would be cheap in comparison. This case has to be thought more of as a very expensive accessory or a bragging piece, than something that's going to do your iPhone any good.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-dragon-and-spider-case-from-anita-mai-tan>1) Dragon and Spider Case from Anita Mai Tan</h2><p>via extravagantrings.com</p><p>The most expensive iPhone case in the world goes to the "Spider and Dragon" case from Anita Mai Tan, which can be yours for $880,000. This case is made of 18-carat white gold and embedded with real diamonds, for a total weight of 32 carats. The attached dragon that clings ferociously to the back of the case might make your iPhone hard to keep in your pocket, but you'd probably want to keep this in a locked glass display, anyway.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9Oop2ZpYGK6sL%2FTZpyxqJWjwKrCxGagqaCfo7Jur8CsnKxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./twitch-streamer-fasffy-wiki-biography-instagram-real-name-reddit-boyfriend-twitter.html><span>←</span><span>Twitch Streamer Fasffy Wiki, Biography, Instagram, Real Name, Reddit, Boyfriend, Twitter</span></a>
