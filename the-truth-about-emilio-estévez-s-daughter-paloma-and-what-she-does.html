Then, his sons Emilio Estévez, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took Martin's real last name</a>, and Charlie Sheen made names for themselves in the '80s, starring in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Hughes films</a>&nbsp;along with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">other members of the Brat Pack</a>. Now a third-generation is making their mark on the business, with Estévez's children following in their father, uncle, and grandfather's footsteps.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But what was it like growing up around such success? Was there pressure to bring even more fame to the family name? Estévez's children probably had to deal with a lot growing up, but it seems like they can march to the beat of their own drums pretty well. We know <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what Taylor Estévez does for a living</a>, but what does his sister do?</p><h2 id=she-s-a-professional-drummer>She's A Professional Drummer</h2><p>While she didn't exactly go into acting, Paloma did go into some form of showbiz. She's a professional drummer and composer in Los Angeles and the "most in-demand," apparently.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Her official website</a> says,&nbsp;"Paloma Estevez is one of the most in-demand drummers in Los Angeles today. Known for her solid deep pocket, this charismatic musician is currently playing with Berlin, Annie Bosko, and Jen Awad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Has A Higher Net Worth: Charlie Sheen Or Emilio Estevez?</a></span></p><p>"Born in Los Angeles, Paloma grew up surrounded by prolific entertainers. She discovered a passion and natural talent for music, playing trombone in jazz and classical genres as a young girl. A chance encounter at age thirteen landed Paloma on stage behind a drum kit with an audience and a full band. Though she’d never played a lick, she grabbed those sticks and has been wailing ever since.</p><p>"An award-winning graduate of The Musician’s Institute in Hollywood, the technically superb Estevez is now a respected session musician, performer, and composer in her own right. She’s toured across the globe, opening for acts like Salt n Pepa, Drowning Pool, and Buckcherry, and has shared the stage as a guest performer with El Chicano and Slash."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It also lists the greats that have "tapped" her talent over the span of her 20-year career, such as producers Bob Clearmountain, Bill Jackson, Tyler Bates, Dito Godwin. She has also shared sessions with veterans Jonathan Moffet “Sugar Foot” and Corney Mims.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Did Emilio Estevez Choose To Give Up Acting?</a></span></p><p>She also endorses Los Cabos Drumsticks and Sabian Cymbals and has been featured on MTV, HULU, National Geographic, ESPN, Access Hollywood, and TLC. Even though she's mainly a rock drummer, she did have teen obsessions with boy bands NSYNC and Backstreet Boys.</p><p>According to Hello Giggles, she started drumming at 13, and as far as influences go, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she loves the great John Bonham</a>, drummer of Led Zeppelin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She&nbsp;told&nbsp;Tom Tom magazine in 2012, "In terms of feel and groove, I have found myself modeling my playing after the great John Bonham from day one," she told the magazine. "It’s always an honor to hear, 'Wow, you sound a lot like John Bonham. I’ve never heard a girl hit so hard!'"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Do Charlie Sheen And Emilio Estevez Still Talk?</a></span></p><p>Now, she's a staff composer for NBC, according to her profile on the website of her alma mater, the Musician's Institute.</p><h2 id=she-s-also-helped-her-dad-out>She's Also Helped Her Dad Out</h2><p>Paloma's only acting credit comes from one of her father's films, The War at Home, but she's composed for film and has even helped her father out on another of his films, The Way, which also starred her grandfather.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She's also composed for the documentary The Last Animals&nbsp;and the short Jimmy & Kenny. But she has&nbsp;a lot of upcoming composing work, including work for the short Unspoken&nbsp;and the video games&nbsp;Shadow Stalkers and MegaRace: DeathMatch.</p><p>She also helped her father in the film The Public. She added some music while Estévez's son Taylor, who's a stuntman, did all of his stunts for him.</p><p>Estévez told Us Weekly, "My daughter is an accomplished musician. She’s a percussionist, so she came in to lay down some tracks on the film. All of the heavy percussion in the film, that’s my daughter."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Commenting on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">working with his children</a>, Estevez said, "We have a great relationship. My kids are older … so I treat them like colleagues and friends as opposed to children."</p><p>Paloma's&nbsp;Instagram is a collage of world tours, meetings, and daily life, but she loves taking selfies in front of her various drum setups. It's obvious that she's gone out there and made a name for herself outside her family. She doesn't even mention them in her bio. Why would she really? She's her own person and probably wanted to have her own life. We shall see what other great projects she takes on in the future, and hopefully, they're with her famous family too. If not, that's totally fine too. Either way, we're bringing earplugs because Paloma slays those drums.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joaquin Antonio Consuelos Suffers From This Disorder And Fans Didn’t Even Know</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6prnIpaCoZZWowabCxLOqZpyRqrSpwMSrZKmZnKS6onnAp5tmr5iWwW6%2Fx55knaeVqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./singer-bobbi-storm-reprimanded-by-delta-employee-for-singing-on-flight.html><span>←</span><span>Singer Bobbi Storm Reprimanded By Delta Employee For Singing On Flight</span></a>
