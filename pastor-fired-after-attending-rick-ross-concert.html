After being voted out of his position, he also became the pastor with the shortest term served. According to reports by AmericaPreachers.com, Willis arrived to Mt. Salem Sunday morning to find his parking and office signs removed. He was also banned from officiating services that morning.</p><p>Miles Langley, a deacon at Mt. Salem also shared with the Christian website that this was not Willis’ first offense — the former pastor was also spotted at a Lil’ Wayne concert 9 months ago.</p><p>“We know that many saints will have mixed opinions from our actions, but this is not how we do things here at Mt. Salem,” he told America Preachers. “We cannot have a pastor praising the world one minute then praising the Lord the next. Period”</p><p>Mt. Salem will have guest pastors in the coming weeks until they appoint a new pastor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6WutMDOq2SfoaKasW6txa2cq2WRqcGmusOipaBlop6wrHnRqKqsZZOku6Sx0a1kam9jZYB1ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mcdonald-s-super-sized-success-formula.html><span>←</span><span>McDonalds Super Sized Success Formula</span></a>
