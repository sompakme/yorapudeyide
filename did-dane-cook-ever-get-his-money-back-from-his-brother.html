It all came to a head around 2010, when Darryl McCauley was discovered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dane <a href=#>figured out what was happening and sued his brother</a>, who later wound up in prison for a number of years. Darryl's wife also went to trial on embezzlement charges.</p><p>In the meantime, Cook continued with his successful career and is now worth about $35 million. But the big question on fans' minds is whether Dane got the stolen cash back.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-did-dane-cook-39-s-brother-take>How Much Money Did Dane Cook's Brother Take?</h2><p>Dane Cook's half-brother Darryl embezzled millions of dollars from Dane's accounts, but hardly anyone wanted to specify an exact amount. Since the crimes occurred between the '90s and '00s, though, the amounts weren't astronomical by today's standards.</p><p>It was a lot of cash, though; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Darryl was charged</a> with 27 counts of "larceny over $250" plus other various counts of embezzlement and forgery. One specific amount was $3M in forged checks. The grand total didn't come out until the terms of Darryl's trial were publicized.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When everything was said and done, Dane Cook's brother was ordered to repay his sibling $12 million.</p><h2 id=where-is-dane-cook-39-s-brother-darryl-mccauley-now>Where Is Dane Cook's Brother Darryl McCauley Now?</h2><p>In 2010, Darryl McCauley was sentenced to "five to six" years in state prison. After his release, he was also slated for ten years of probation. Looking at the dates, Darryl should have been released from prison around 2015 or 2016 and remained on probation until at least 2025.</p><p>But recent headlines from arguably obscure (and potentially untrustworthy) websites suggest that Darryl McCauley died. So is Dane Cook's brother dead, and what happened to him?</p><p>Due to the lack of reputable news sources reporting on Darryl, the public can assume that he is still alive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then the question becomes, where has he been since prison, and did he ever pay Dane back the money he owed? It didn't seem likely, at least as of 2018; that's when Dane tweeted a response to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeopardy question</a> that centered on his unfortunate family story.</p><p>The answer, of course, was "embezzlement," but Dane didn't reveal anything other than that he was a bit miffed by watching Jeopardy to relax, yet seeing his family drama splashed on the board. He still seems a bit bitter, which is to be expected -- especially if he hasn't gotten his money back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-dane-cook-39-s-brother-pay-millions-in-restitution>Did Dane Cook's Brother Pay Millions In Restitution?</h2><p>When it comes to paying back literal millions of dollars, it's highly unlikely that victims of embezzlement will see much cash, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">say fans</a>. After all, someone who's shady enough to drain funds from a family member has likely found ways to cover up what they're doing -- and make the money disappear.</p><p>At least, that's fans' assumption, given that McCauley apparently claimed he had "lost" the money. While others questioned the ability of someone on trial to simply say they "lost" $12M or more, the justice system seems to have limited abilities in such cases.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Deeper Look At The Ups And Downs In Comedian Dane Cook's Private Life</a></span></p><p>What likely happened, fans speculate, is that McCauley was ordered to pay restitution the same way that parents are often ordered to pay child support. In short, through small, manageable payments based on his paycheck earnings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That probably means Darryl McCauley has some low amount to pay per month, for basically the rest of his life. That's assuming he ever gets a "real job," though, say commenters.</p><h2 id=fans-think-darryl-is-living-under-the-radar>Fans Think Darryl Is Living Under The Radar</h2><p>Fans of Dane Cook speculate that not only is Darryl McCauley living under the radar, hence the rumors about his death, but also that he's lying low professionally. While he probably has some sort of job, one would assume, he's likely not making those restitution payments -- or at least keeping them very low.</p><p>Because his checks would be garnished for literally the rest of his life (do some quick math on how long it would take to repay a $12 million sum!), commenters surmised that Darryl won't even make an effort.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Comedian Dane Cook Spends His $35 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Besides, many suspicious followers of the story think that Darryl has the cash hidden somewhere, and that he'll slowly siphon it out for everyday expenses. That means he won't need a real job -- or to be on the hook for restitution.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, though, Dane Cook still has something of a career in Hollywood, even if <a href=#>viewers haven't loved all of his film projects</a>. And his $35M net worth, while missing at least $12M if not more, is still pretty impressive.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What Is Comedian, Dane Cook Up To Today?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdma6vsYycpqijXZrDpr6MoJytZZiewG65zqecsmWSlrCsecWrpqZlmJ7Abq7RqKuhnaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cj-dippa-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>CJ Dippa Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
