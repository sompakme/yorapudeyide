Gosling wound up living with Timberlake during that era, and after their time on the show, each guy went on to become a huge star in different areas of the industry.</p><p>So, are Ryan Gosling and Justin Timberlake still friends? Let’s take a closer look and see where these two former Mouseketeers stand today.</p><h2 id=gosling-lived-with-timberlake-while-on-the-mickey-mouse-club>Gosling Lived With Timberlake While On The Mickey Mouse Club</h2><p>The Mickey Mouse Club was coming back for an all new generation, and if the show wanted to find success like it had back in the day, then it needed to find kids with some potential. Turns out, this show was way ahead of the curve, as it landed names like Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, J.C. Chasez, Christina Aguilera, and even Britney Spears.</p><p>During their time on the show together, Timberlake and Gosling actually lived with one another, which helped them grow closer than some of the other members of the cast at that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> “His mother had to keep her job in Canada the second year that we were on the television show, so my mom was his guardian for like six months. We were probably a little closer that the rest of the kids that were on the show just because we had to share a bathroom,” Timberlake <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Ellen</a> .“We stole a golf cart. And we were like, ‘Yeah, man–We’re stealing a golf cart!’ We drove into MGM Studios…which is totally illegal by the way. I was like, ‘What do you want to do, thug?’ Ryan was like, ‘I don’t know, cuz.’ Because that’s definitely how we talked,” he continued.Eventually, things would come to an end on&nbsp; The Mickey Mouse Club , and while their careers would take drastically different routes, one striking similarity that occurred was that both men were able to become massive stars in their own right. <span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Celebrities Have Owned Restaurants</a></span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-both-became-stars>They Both Became Stars</h2><p>For Justin Timberlake, music was his vehicle to the top. He was a boy band star in NSYNC before turning into a major solo act. He has sold millions of records around the world and has headlined some of the biggest music venues on the planet, leaving behind a legacy in the business.</p><p>As for Gosling, instead of sticking with singing and dancing, he got into the acting side of the business and wound up turning into a critically-acclaimed performer that has also been nominated for two Academy Awards. Some of his biggest films include&nbsp;Remember the Titans, The Big Short, and&nbsp;La La Land.</p><p>After becoming stars, interviewers grew curious about their time together growing up on Disney Channel. Gosling had mentioned sleeping on Timberlake’s couch during those days, and Timberlake was more than happy to correct this with Jimmy Fallon.</p><p>“So he tried to make it seem like he was bohemian even back then? Gosling got his own bed. He didn’t sleep on the couch… I’m picturing a ten-year-old Gosling bumming Marlboro Reds off some bum, growing hipster facial hair…,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said Timberlake</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Co-Stars Who Fell In Love On Set… But Didn’t Last</a></span></p><h2 id=where-they-stand-now>Where They Stand Now</h2><p>As time went on, people started to wonder about the pair and if they had managed to stay in touch with their careers going in wildly different directions. Judging by their own words, it doesn’t seem like they are the best of friends.</p><p>In 2013, Gosling would say that it’s “like anything where you’re friends with somebody in elementary school or something. How many friends do you still have from elementary school?”</p><p>Meanwhile, Timberlake told Ellen, “Yeah…you know…he’s working a lot. It’s hard to keep up with him.”</p><p>Since these quotes, the duo has been snapped together at the Oscars, but it sure doesn’t seem like they are as close as they were when they were kids. With busy schedules and families, it can be easy to drift apart, and we have to imagine that they are both happy for each other, given all of the success that they wound up finding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Timberlake, Chris Evans And 8 Other Celebrities Appearing In Apple TV Movies</a></span></p><p>From&nbsp;Mickey Mouse Club to major stars, Ryan Gosling and Justin Timberlake conquered Hollywood and have left behind huge shoes to fill for other performs looking to find the same type of success.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Hollywood Actors Who Are Also Screenwriters</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dp8aiuoygpqykmaO0bq3NnWSjraOptq9506Kkm52ioa6ssYysq6KknGKzs7XEp5usZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./17-lightweight-blazers-to-beat-the-heat.html><span>←</span><span>17 Lightweight Blazers to Beat the Heat</span></a>
