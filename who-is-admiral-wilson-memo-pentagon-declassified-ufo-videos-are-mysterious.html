They’re either lying under oath or unprepared for the amount of research they’ll have to do. It will take years for them to catch up.</strong></p><p>This congressional hearing about UFOs is incredible. The “Wilson Memo,” which alleges alien bodies are collected from crashes and reverse-engineered spacecraft, was just signed into law by a congressman.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=admiral-wilsons-memo-wikipedia></span>Admiral Wilson’s Memo Wikipedia<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wilson Memo doesn’t have his own Wikipedia handle yet. He has been the topic of a trend and has been viral on the internet, especially on&nbsp;Twitter.</p><p>He has been gaining attention due to the leaked documents regarding UFOs, except for two witnesses who had never heard of the Wilson or Malmstrom events. They were either lying or completely ignorant about the subject.</p><p>One person on Twitter said that he had spent 60 years researching them. Hopefully, all of the unredacted files they’ll be given will blow their heads.</p><p>One user also said, “Despite the polarization of American politics, no one spoke in Tyson’s bitter, sarcastic tone.” They used the word extraterrestrial, mentioned the Wilson document, presented a low-resolution video, and will have another closed session.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=on-twitter-the-pentagon-released-declassified-ufo-videos></span>On Twitter, The Pentagon Released Declassified UFO Videos.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, three enormous flying saucers holding alien cosmonauts were discovered in New Mexico in 1950, according to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. The FBI has now explained the note about the flying saucer submitted to Hoover — and, unwittingly, gave a clinic on how to evaluate a secret intelligence report.</p><p>The FBI’s main message was: please relax in its current explanation. No evidence of extraterrestrial visitation was ever discovered by the FBI.</p><figure></figure><p>Even Hoover, a paranoid fanatic who was eager to sell outlandish charges about secret armies of communist terrorists, stopped looking into UFOs four months after receiving the report from Washington-based Special Agent-in-Charge Guy Hottel.</p><p>The FBI’s latest explanation states, “Our Washington Field Office didn’t think enough of that flying saucer story to investigate it.” UFOs have been trending, and people are curious to know more about the matter.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=explore-wilson-memos-age-family></span>Explore Wilson Memo’s Age & Family.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wilson Memo hasn’t revealed any information regarding his age or family details. He is quite low-key regarding his personal life. We will update it soon as we get to know more about him.</p><p>Wilson is a family man and likes to spend time with his&nbsp;family. His information is not declared on any page as if now, because he is gaining so much popularity, soon he might have his own Wikipedia.</p><p>Wilson asked which vote would bear the cost of publishing Admiral Wilson’s official memorandum. That is included in the Secretary of State for War’s recent work on compulsory service and the cost of producing that volume.</p><p>He has been getting media attention, and many people are currently talking about him. Wilson is a very kind and gentle man who helps those people in need, and everyone loves him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yam6ahopa5bsPIpaqopl2isq67jKmcp6yRnLyvecOemqWZo6i2p7XEnWSunp9iw6qwxKiqZpmimnquxdKtnKuhn6rAbn6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./see-sarah-michelle-gellar-s-mario-kart-themed-cake-for-son-rocky-photo.html><span>←</span><span>See Sarah Michelle Gellar's Mario Kart-Themed Cake for Son Rocky: Photo</span></a>
