That the young couple’s reel romance turned real sent their fans wild. Sharon and Gabby announced their engagement to a nation that was in love with them for their numerous hit romantic movies.<br>The church wedding took place on September 23, 1984, with no less than then president Ferdinand Marcos serving as principal sponsor. Sharon and Gabby’s daughter, Maria Kristina Cassandra Concepcion (KC) was born on April 1985.<br>It was a truly an enchanting event! People said it was the local version of the U.K.’s Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s grand wedding ceremony held in 1981 in London, which was viewed worldwide. Sharon and Gabby first had a civil wedding. But of course, given the stature of Sharon’s prominent background, as well as their shared celebrity status, a church wedding was a necessity both for spiritual reasons and for publicity.<br>In a 1981 file interview published in Filipino Star magazine, Sharon recalled the first time she and Gabby first had a real conversation away from the cameras. The two were in Manila at the time to shoot some scenes for the movie, Dear Heart.<br>“April 5 (1981) to be exact. We attended this rally at Plaza Miranda and since we could not watch the proceedings of the program because there were so many people, we went to the rooftop and we sat down and talked. We talked about our likes and dislikes, the intrigues in the movies, our zodiac signs and other things that came into our head,” revealed Sharon to writer Remy Umerez.<br>It was the start of a rosy friendship that eventually morphed into romance.<br>The interview had all the hallmarks of young love written all over it and Sharon put down all her defenses when asked about Gabby’s endearing traits.<br>“He’s conservative, always concerned, protective and thoughtful. He is good and nice all over him. It’s in him already to be very likeable. We have a lot of things in common. He is jolly and he tells funny things. He is a perfect gentleman. He is the type of person who couldn’t even hurt a fly. He gives importance to women,” a young Sharon rosily elaborated.<br>Unfortunately the marriage never lasted as the two eventually parted ways, much to the dismay of their fans.<br>Though various speculations were brought up on why the union crumbled, it is easy to conclude that their young age took its toll on the once touted fairy-tale marriage.<br>Sharon would later admit that she fell into a black hole after the separation. But she’s always proud that she never resorted to drugs or even alcohol to numb the pain and emptiness that follows a failed marriage.<br>Several years after, a more mature and happily married Sharon fondly looked back on her first marriage and related it with her current marital status with Senator Kiko Pangilinan.<br>“After my first marriage (to Gabby Concepcion) broke up, I’d always say, ‘Hindi ako nakipaghiwalay sa asawa para magwala. We parted ways because magkaiba ang aming paningin sa marriage and family. It didn’t mean he was evil, hindi lang talaga kami magkasundo,” she confided to the Philippine Daily Inquirer in a published interview dated March 31 of this year.<br>“Now that I’m older, however, I’m more forgiving-and I take responsibility for what could have been my part in the failure of that relationship. But I never gave up on marriage-or the idea of it. I always knew I’d be ready to be a wife and mother again. You can’t allow anyone who has caused you pain to make you feel defeated or less of a woman,” she ended positively.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLTOrJuarJWZxKm7jZympmeUlsGqusZoqqGZoqS7bq%2FUp5ytmV2Wu6V5xpqZm7FdmLyvr8SpmqKnng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sam-hunt-pregnant-wife-hannah-lee-fowler-split-divorce-details.html><span>←</span><span>Sam Hunt, Pregnant Wife Hannah Lee Fowler Split: Divorce Details</span></a>
