So, where does that leave us? In the middle. And everybody knows that middle kid is always f**kin’ spoiled. And always think he the best. And the ’90s era was – I don’t know. It was the era where we was branching Hip Hop over to the commercial scene.”</p><p>The New Jersey native expressed how he thought when the rap game was in the hands of lyricists in the ‘90s, they were able to take hip hop to another level. “When we had it it was large. We elevated that b*tch…All the heavy hitter commercials. All the heavy hitter brand names. And they started adding elements of Hip Hop to be the cool guys on the block with they brand. So, we kind of—Our era brought that over to make it, I would say a universal language,” he continued.</p><p>To end his statement, the Muddy Waters rapper said, “I can say that our era helped other cultures understand what our culture was about through hip hop at that time. I think our era’s the best and that’s just what it is.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6eypbnAp2StmZygwG60zrBkoqaWocKmutOimKVlpJ2yboWPrGSwnaKaerW7jKGgqWWYpL1uf5dyaW5uXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./narges-rashidi-height-in-feet-wikipedia-biography-husband-age-and-wikipedia-10-facts-to-know-ab.html><span>←</span><span>Narges Rashidi Height In Feet, Wikipedia, Biography, Husband Age, and Wikipedia: 10 Facts To Know Ab</span></a>
