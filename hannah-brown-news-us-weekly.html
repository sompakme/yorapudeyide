She competed against her future Bachelor castmate <strong>Hannah Godwin</strong> in Miss Alabama USA in 2017, a year before Brown won the title. She also competed in Miss USA 2018, but did not place. She used her platform to help people suffering from depression and anxiety.</p><p>Brown vied for <a href=#><strong>Colton Underwood</strong></a>’s love on season 23 of The Bachelor in 2018. She finished in seventh place and was subsequently named the lead for The Bachelorette season 15. She got engaged to&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Jed Wyatt</strong></a> on the show, but broke up with him after hearing conflicting stories about his past relationship. During the live finale, Brown reunited with her runner-up,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Tyler Cameron</strong></a>, and asked him out on a date. After their brief reconciliation, Cameron had a nearly two-month fling with <a href=#><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a>.</p><p>Brown competed on season 28 of Dancing With the Stars from September 2019 to November 2019.
