Since its rise to popularity in 1961, the Marvel Universe has continued to expand, with the first movie, Iron Man, being released in 2008.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many of the movies follow on from the Marvel books and comics, with the first-ever Marvel comic being released in 1939. However, the '<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel era' officially began in 1961</a>, marking the transition out of Timely Comics into the Marvel name. Due to its long-running history and much-loved superhero stories, it's no surprise that the franchise has built such a large fan base, and it's this success that allows the Marvel actors of today so successful in their own right too.</p><p>One of these highly-successful actors is Australian-born Chris Hemsworth, who has played a large role in the Marvel Universe. So, where exactly are his next roles taking him?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="These Box-Office Hits Prove Chris Hemsworth Is So Much More Than Just Thor">These Box-Office Hits Prove Chris Hemsworth Is So Much More Than Just Thor</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-chris-hemsworth-break-into-hollywood>How Did Chris Hemsworth Break Into Hollywood?</h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Chris Hemsworth has a total net worth of $130 million dollars. However, this isn't surprising <a href=#>considering he is one of the highest-paid actors</a> in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, much of his net worth comes from his highly successful acting career. However, it has not been an easy journey for the Australian-born actor. Before landing any of his major roles, he started his career by appearing in local television shows, such as Home and Away, which he appeared on between 2004 and 2007.</p><p>It was not until 2009 that Hemsworth made his breakthrough in the acting world, landing bigger and better roles as he progressed through the ranks.</p><p>One of Hemsworth's highest-paying roles was for Thor in Avengers: Endgame, for which he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly paid a salary of $15 million</a>. For his role in Extraction, it is estimated he was paid a salary anywhere upwards of $5 million US dollars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to landing such desirable roles, it's not hard to see how each salary can quickly add up for Hemsworth, who now earns millions a year. In 2018 alone, the Australian actor reportedly made a whopping $64.5 million, which certainly isn't too shabby.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Chris Hemsworth Sells Fitness App For $200M To Jeff Bezos's Brother">Chris Hemsworth Sells Fitness App For $200M To Jeff Bezos's Brother</a></span></p><p>Of course, Hemsworth is not the only well-paid actor in the Marvel Universe. His co-stars also rack in some serious cash, with Brie Larson set to earn $15 million for her role as Captain Marvel in Captain Marvel 2 and Benedict Cumberbatch earning almost $17 million for a total of five movie roles.</p><p>However, this isn't really surprising considering how highly successful the Marvel franchise has become.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-other-movies-has-chris-hemsworth-starred-in>What Other Movies Has Chris Hemsworth Starred In?</h2><p>As well as playing Thor in Avengers: Endgame, Chris Hemsworth has also landed many major roles throughout his career, both big and small. The 38-year-old Australian actor has starred in Extraction, Men In Black, Rush, In The Heart Of The Sea, Interceptor, Interstellar, and Spiderman, among many more Marvel films and other roles.</p><p>However, that's only to list a few. The actor has some serious baggage under his belt when it comes to the number of movies he's starred in.</p><p>Having become such a high-profile actor, it may come as no surprise that Hemsworth becomes seriously dedicated to any role he is faced with. For example, whilst preparing for his role as Owen Chase in The Heart Of The Sea, the actor <a href=#>dedicated himself to a seriously crazy diet in order to get into shape</a> for the role.</p><p>In order to lose the 30lbs required for the part, he cut his calorie consumption to a measly 500 calories a day (the recommended intake for a male is 2,000) and began working out every day. While this sounds like quite an unpleasant experience, it shows how much Hemsworth must've wanted the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Chris Hemsworth Trolls Brother Liam On His Birthday">Chris Hemsworth Trolls Brother Liam On His Birthday</a></span></p><p>One of the <a href=#>highest-grossing films that the actor has starred in</a> is 'Snow White And The Huntsman', which made $396.6 million in box office sales. However, as mentioned earlier, this is just one of many big films the actor has starred in.</p><h2 id=who-does-chris-hemsworth-play-in-the-new-spiderhead-movie>Who Does Chris Hemsworth Play in The New Spiderhead Movie?</h2><p>Much anticipation has been building up for the release of the 2022 film Spiderhead in which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Hemsworth is set to play Steve Abnesti</a>, a scientist who is described as a "brilliant visionary". Other actors who are set to star in the movie include, Miles Teller, Ashley Lawrence, Tess Haubrich, Bebe Bettencourt, and Charles Parnell among others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film is set to follow the story of two inmates of a prison, that is run by a scientist who performs experiments on his subjects whilst they are filled with mind-altering drugs.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the scientist is said to be a 'brilliant visionary' which could make the story all the more interesting for those who have not yet watched it.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# title="Are Chris Hemsworth's Arms The Reason He Was Cast As Hulk Hogan?">Are Chris Hemsworth's Arms The Reason He Was Cast As Hulk Hogan?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrLatuIycn6uho2K1prnSsKarrJhiva2t2GaqqaGUmr%2BpscCdZKanpp6ycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-alindra-person-meet-american-boxer-terence-crawford-wife-on-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Alindra Person?
