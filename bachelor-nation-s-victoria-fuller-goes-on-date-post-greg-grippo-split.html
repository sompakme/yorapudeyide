It’s hard,” he said, adding that the end of their romance was “really sad” and he wants to “respect” Fuller as they move on. “[I’m] not going to detail anything. But we definitely ended things. … I don’t have anything bad to say. She’s amazing and I know that she’s going to continue to do amazing things.”</p><p>Fuller, for her part, <a href=#>addressed the breakup</a> the following month. “Not really sure where to start here but I haven’t felt up to talking ab [sic] my break up to put it bluntly,” Fuller wrote via Instagram Story in May. “Break ups are never easy and especially so publicly. I absolutely LOVE sharing my life with you guys but some moments are meant to be private.”</p><p>Fuller continued her message by encouraging others to “be kind” because you never know what they’re going through.</p><p>“Everyone handles breakups differently, I’m choosing to process mine in peace,” she explained, adding she’s grateful for those who have “reached out and been supportive” since their split. “I wish him nothing but the best and can’t wait to see where life takes us.”</p><p>Fuller joined Bachelor Nation as a contestant on <strong>Peter Weber</strong>’s season of The Bachelor, which aired in 2020. Grippo, for his part, vied for the affections of <strong>Katie Thurston</strong> during her season of The Bachelorette in summer 2021 but self-eliminated.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Fuller and Grippo first connected at the Governors Ball festival in New York City in 2021, she opted to go on Bachelor in Paradise, where <a href=#>she got engaged</a> to <strong>Johnny DePhillipo</strong>. However, she ended her engagement to DePhillipo, 27, and reconnected with Grippo.</p><p>DePhillipo accused Fuller of cheating on him with Grippo, but she denied the claim.</p><p>“Greg and I have very similar values and so we are just figuring it out right now. But we know what we want at the end of the day, and we’ll see what happens. He’s an amazing man,” she <a href=#>gushed to Us Weekly</a> in November 2022. “He truly is. He’s been nothing but uplifting and encouraging through this whole experience. And that’s the type of partner that I want. Somebody who makes me feel good and makes me a better person.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270WalmqyZpLu0edWimq2nop6ubrLUpaOeql2cvKa%2FjKilZpyRqbJuvM6sq2afopq0brPRoqepp12ova2102g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alec-musser-dies-at-50-fiancee-paige-press-pays-tribute.html><span>←</span><span>Alec Musser Dies at 50, Fiancee Paige Press Pays Tribute</span></a>
