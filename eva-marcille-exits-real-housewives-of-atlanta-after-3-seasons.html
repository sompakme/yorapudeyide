However, after speaking with my family and representatives, I believe that what I hope to accomplish for the culture and community will be better served by focusing on other opportunities. I look forward to serving my community on The Rickey Smiley Morning Show and finding ways to be a voice during this transformational time in our country for people of color.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Eva-Marcille-Exits-Real-Housewives-of-Atlanta-After-3-Seasons.jpg><p>Marcille joined the Bravo reality series as a friend of the Housewives during season 10, which premiered in November 2017. She was promoted to full-time Housewife the following year and also served as a main cast member during the 12th and most recent season.</p><p>“The time that I spent on Housewives, I enjoyed myself, I cried, I laughed, I obviously fought, and we did a lot of things,” the America’s Next Top Model season 3 winner said on The Rickey Smiley Morning on Tuesday. “But most importantly, I made some great friendships with some beautiful women.”</p><p>Marcille explained to listeners that she knew her “time [was] up” after growing her family with attorney <a href=#><strong>Michael Sterling</strong></a>, whom she <a href=#>married in October 2018</a>. The couple share sons Michael Jr., 2, and Maverick, 8 months. The reality star is also the mother of daughter Marley, 6, with ex <a href=#><strong>Kevin McCall</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“There is a lot of work to be done,” she said. “And so, I decided to spend my time and energy focusing on my kids and my community. And not so much reality show business.”</p><p>Season 12 of RHOA, which ended in May, also starred <a href=#><strong>NeNe Leakes</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kandi Burruss</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Cynthia Bailey</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kenya Moore</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Porsha Williams</strong></a>. <a href=#>TMZ</a>&nbsp;recently reported that <strong>Yovanna Momplaisir</strong> — who was involved in the show’s SnakeGate drama after being <a href=#>accused of secretly recording conversations with the cast</a> at the behest of Leakes — is expected to become an official cast member next season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJyvmV2irrOvyKWjnmWVrba1v4yrnJqkXZ28tr%2FEsKCvnaNivKd5wK2jmqaklnqistOeqWZrXaiyor%2FOp6po</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./does-marquise-goodwin-have-kids-meet-his-family-and-wife-on-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Does Marquise Goodwin Have Kids?
