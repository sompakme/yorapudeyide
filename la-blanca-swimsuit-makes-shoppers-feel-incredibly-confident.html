Just think — some of Us&nbsp;might not be feeling like our most confident selves, which can be difficult to deal with when we’re going to be hitting the beach in swimwear!</p><p>If two-piece bikinis are out of your comfort zone, a one-piece is obviously the ideal choice for you. The tricky part is landing on the right suit that flatters your figure and makes you feel gorgeous in the process. Well, it’s your lucky day — because according to countless reviews, this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one-piece from La Blanca</a> does just that!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/La-Blanca-Island-Goddess-One-Piece-Swimsuit-Blue-Moon.jpeg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">La Blanca Island Goddess One-Piece Swimsuit</a> for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$79</a>, available at Nordstrom!</strong></p><p>Though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this suit</a> is definitely on the simpler side, it’s one of the best and most versatile options that we’ve come across. Hundreds of Nordstrom shoppers can’t stop raving about how great they feel when they wear <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this piece</a>, and the design majorly factors into that. The ruching along the bodice is certainly the standout feature. This can help create a more streamlined figure and hide any areas along the stomach and waist that might not make you feel pool party-ready. It’s lined and has removable cups in the bust area to give you a touch of extra coverage.</p><p>This swimsuit has a simple scoop neckline and adjustable tank top-style straps. The sides of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the suit</a> cut fairly high, but not so much so that it feels like you bought it from an ’80s vintage store. Ecstatic reviewers also note that it definitely flatters the backside, and overall just looks fantastic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/La-Blanca-Island-Goddess-One-Piece-Swimsuit-Birds-Of-Paradise.jpeg><p>La Blanca Island Goddess One-Piece Swimsuit (Birds Of Paradise)</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">La Blanca Island Goddess One-Piece Swimsuit</a> for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$79</a>, available at Nordstrom!</strong></p><p>You can pick <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this suit</a> up in four strong shades: a plum wine purple, bright coral, deep royal blue and classic black. This is a great suit to pick up if you’re going on vacation — whether it’s a family affair or with the crew. It’s not too conservative — but not too sultry, so it strikes the perfect balance between the two ends of the style spectrum!</p><p>We also love that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this suit’s</a> design is classic and that it’ll stay in style for years to come. The first-hand testimonials about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this suit</a> alone have convinced&nbsp;Us&nbsp;that we truly need it in our lives. One reviewer said that they “haven’t worn a swimsuit since my early twenties and this made my me feel confident when I wore it to the pool.” If that’s not a persuasive enough review, than we don’t know what is!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">La Blanca Island Goddess One-Piece Swimsuit</a> for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$79</a>, available at Nordstrom!</strong></p><p><strong>Not what you’re looking for?
