But that’s still $1."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

But that’s still $1.7 million more than the Bilyeus — currently co-owners of Impact Theory, a globally popular empowerment interview show — paid for the Spanish Revival-inspired villa almost eight years ago, back in spring 2015.</p><p>Tucked away behind double gates on a full acre of land in the Beverly Hills Post Office neighborhood, the six-bedroom, nine-bath home was built in 2008 and doesn’t look as if it’s undergone any changes at all during the Bilyeu’s tenure. Coming in at nearly 11,000 square feet, the three-level dwelling features a wealth of opulent living space adorned throughout with ornate crown molding, high vaulted ceilings and arched doorways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Among the highlights: a rotunda-topped foyer that flows to two oversized living rooms sporting custom cut-stone floors and marble fireplaces, plus a gourmet eat-in kitchen outfitted with high-end Sub-Zero and Miele appliances. An upstairs master retreat displays a fireplace, mini-bar, private balcony, dual walk-in closets and a luxe bath equipped with a jetted tub; and elsewhere is a secondary master suite that opens to the backyard, along with media and game rooms, an office and a wine cellar.</p><p>As for the park-like grounds, the backyard hosts plenty of spots ideal for al fresco lounging and entertaining, along with a freeform pool and raised spa surrounded by a sundeck, cabana and sport court. There’s also an attached two-car garage and extra parking for at least 20 vehicles out front courtesy of a spacious motorcourt.</p><p>For now, the Bilyeus still own an ultra-contemporary showpiece in the hills above Sunset Strip that they paid $35.5 million for around three years ago — shortly after their highly successful nutrition-based food company sold to the maker of Atkins bars for a cool $1 billion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>MDLBeast Soundstorm 2022: Biggest Comeback Of All Time, Five Rap Legends Light Up The Big Beast Stage With DJ Khaled</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaipaCWsLV506GcqKqpYrOwwc2dnKurXZ3CqLGMpqyloJ%2BhuaK6w2abq6Gmmnqurc2soKimXZu2r63LpbBmq5WhubR5xaipZmlgYrqquMuipqdn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dale-earnhardt-jr-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Net Worth</span></a>
