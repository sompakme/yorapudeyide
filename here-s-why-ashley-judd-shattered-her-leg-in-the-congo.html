Ashley, what are you doing?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While other celebs have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gotten hate</a> for travelling mid-pandemic, Ashley's reasons for flying all the way from her home in the USA to the wilderness of West Africa are actually pretty noble. Here's what the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">former A-lister</a> has been up to.</p><h2 id=she-s-researching-a-humanitarian-crisis>She's Researching a Humanitarian Crisis</h2><p>Ashley's statement about tripping and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly losing her leg</a> mentioned that she was in the jungle as part of a UN research team. According to an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IG Live interview</a> she gave this weekend, her team was headed to visit mineral wells in the eastern Congo.</p><p>Most of us are familiar with the idea of a 'blood diamond' (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thanks Kanye</a>) but there are other precious minerals being mined in Africa that power our modern phones, laptops, and smart devices. Congalese children risk their lives to collect these minerals, and Ashley says enough is enough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Our consumer practices help create and sustain the complex humanitarian crisis that is in the Congo, we have to talk about what's happening," she explained to the reporter on IG Live. "The minerals that come out of the east are what is enabling us to have this live conversation."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=bc-title-link title="Angeline Jolie Discusses Use Of Technology To Help Refugee Services During Pandemic" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angeline Jolie Discusses Use Of Technology To Help Refugee Services During Pandemic</a></span></p><h2 id=she-s-educating-people-about-conflict-minerals>She's Educating People About 'Conflict Minerals'</h2><p>Ashley's passion for this issue was clear as she described, in detail, exactly what conflict minerals are all about.</p><p>"The coltan, and the tungsten, and the tantalum - it's what makes the screen light up, it's what makes things flicker, it's what makes things go 'ping' and 'ding' and all of those alerts," she said. "And those are called conflict minerals, and I'll tell you who's getting the minerals out of the ground. Little children."</p><p>Ashley knows what she's talking about. Recent reports <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have shown </a>the direct connection between mineral mining and child exploitation. Companies like Apple now have to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">publicly share</a> exactly how conflict in the Congo is part of their business model.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=bc-title-link title="A Look Back At The Time Benedict Cumberbatch Was Abducted In Africa" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Look Back At The Time Benedict Cumberbatch Was Abducted In Africa</a></span></p><h2 id=she-wants-fans-to-be-mindful>She Wants Fans to Be Mindful</h2><p>We can't all go to the Congo right now and help children dig for tungsten. What Ashely says we CAN do is keep those working conditions in mind when we purchase our devices. Maybe think twice before upgrading that iPhone.</p><p>"Our consumer practices, as far fetched as that may sound to some people, are contributing to Faisa [a child miner] walking in the forest and his flip flop breaking," she said. "We must understand that what we do on a daily basis, in our sweet little home in America is connected to the misery and suffering of the Congo."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a class=bc-title-link title="Trevor Noah Breaks Down How The World Can Learn From Africa In Tackling COVID-19" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trevor Noah Breaks Down How The World Can Learn From Africa In Tackling COVID-19</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmmKygnJrGbrbUnZtmq5iWwbWx0Z6bZqCVp3qtscZmoKdlpJ2ybq%2FOp56oZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hannah-brown-news-us-weekly.html><span>←</span><span>Hannah Brown News - Us Weekly</span></a>
