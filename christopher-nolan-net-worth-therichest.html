The 40-year-old met his producer and wife, Emma Thomas, inset, at University College London. The couple bring a touch of England to Tinseltown, Nolan with his foppish blond mop and Thomas wearing pearls at premieres. Film-making is a family affair. Nolan’s brother Jonathan is his writing partner, his actor uncle John has acted in his films and one of his sons made an appearance in Inception. The acclaim for his Batman series was matched only by its commercial success. Batman Begins, released in 2005, notched up more than $372m at the box office. In 2008, its sequel, The Dark Knight, grossed more than $1billion. The follow-up, The Dark Knight Rises, is due for release next year(2012) and Nolan is set to give Superman his magic touch too. Nolan’s seven feature-length films have made nearly $2.5billion. Vanity Fair’s 2010 list of Hollywood’s top earners ranked Nolan fourth with $71.5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Christopher has worked with some of the biggest stars in the world -- including Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Al Pacino.Nolan is the founder of the production company Syncopy Films.He often collaborates with his wife, producer Emma Thomas,and his brother, screenwriter Jonathan Nolan.Nolan and wife Emma Thomas have four children and reside in Los Angeles, California.The 2011 Sunday Times valued the couple's net worth at £70 million.</p><h2 id=earnings-amp-financial-data>Earnings & Financial Data</h2><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Date</p></th><th scope=col><p>Category</p></th><th scope=col><p>Description</p></th><th scope=col><p>Amount</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>2013</p></td><td><p>Project Earnings</p></td><td><p>The worldwide box office earnings of the film "Transcedence" where he served as producer</p></td><td><p>$53,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>Project Earnings</p></td><td><p>The worldwide box office earnings of the film "Man of Steel" where he served as writer, producer</p></td><td><p>$668,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2011</p></td><td><p>Project Earnings</p></td><td><p>The worldwide box office earnings of the film "The Dark Knight Rises" where he served as director, writer, producer</p></td><td><p>$1,000,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2009</p></td><td><p>Project Earnings</p></td><td><p>The worldwide box office earnings of the film "Inception" where he served as director, writer, producer</p></td><td><p>$825,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2009</p></td><td><p>Salary</p></td><td><p>Salary from the film Inception</p></td><td><p>$69,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2007</p></td><td><p>Project Earnings</p></td><td><p>The worldwide box office earnings of the film "The Dark Knight" where he served as director, writer, producer</p></td><td><p>$1,000,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2005</p></td><td><p>Project Earnings</p></td><td><p>The worldwide box office earnings of the film "The Prestige" where he served as director, writer, producer</p></td><td><p>$109,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2004</p></td><td><p>Project Earnings</p></td><td><p>The worldwide box office earnings of the film "Batman Begins" where he served as director, writer</p></td><td><p>$375,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2001</p></td><td><p>Project Earnings</p></td><td><p>The worldwide box office earnings of the film "Insomnia" where he served as director</p></td><td><p>$113,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1999</p></td><td><p>Project Earnings</p></td><td><p>The worldwide box office earnings of the film "Memento" where he served as director, writer</p></td><td><p>$39,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1997</p></td><td><p>Project Earnings</p></td><td><p>The worldwide box office earnings of the film "Following" where he served as director, writer, producer</p></td><td><p>$240,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1997</p></td><td><p>Salary</p></td><td><p>Accumulated earnings from his older films</p></td><td><p>$2,500,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BvsdOwpqusmGSwprjEm2adoaKasLW70WiaoaqZqMGwvMeeqWamn6Gur3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brooklyn-beckham-david-beckham-s-son-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-girlfriend-family.html><span>←</span><span>Brooklyn Beckham (David Beckhams Son) Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp;</span></a>
