Nicole is Brenda Harvey-Richie's only child, whom she adopted with Lionel Richie back in the '80s.</p><p>Nicole was placed with Lionel and Brenda when her biological mother, Karen Moss, could no longer care for her. The adoption wasn't finalized until Nicole was nine, but it seems as if she was with the Richies full-time since she was about four, according to quotes from Lionel.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lionel-richie.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Lionel Richie Was Sued For Plagiarism For Years Creating A Dark Mark On One Of His Best Songs</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Two songwriters named Gene Thompson and Tracey Singleton sued Richie in U.S. District Court and sought $3 million in damages.</span><p><a href=#>Nicole Richie hasn't spoken about her biological mother much</a> but did reveal that she wanted to reach out when pregnant with her first child.

About a year after Nicole's adoption was apparently finalized, the two had a bitter spat and wound up divorcing.</p><p>The story goes that Brenda discovered Lionel was cheating on her with Diane Alexander. At the time, in 1988, Brenda made headlines for apparently assaulting Lionel, trespassing, and disturbing the peace, among other charges.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lionel-richie-on-american-idol.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Lionel Richie's Ex Brenda Harvey Has A Surprisingly Low Worth Given His Millions</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Lionel Richie's net worth is staggering, but his first wife's worth is very low despite the pair's collaborations in music.</span><p>Lionel and Brenda divorced in 1993, and he went on to marry Diane Alexander in 1995 — but their son Miles arrived in 1994.

Along with gushing about her daughter Nicole, Brenda also posts on social media about her ex's two kids, calling herself "Mama B" when writing about Sofia and wishing her and Nicole a happy "National Daughter's Day."</p><p>Commenters routinely shower Brenda with praise for being an "inspiration," while Sofia Richie herself replied to her dad's former wife's post by saying "Love you so much."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6DA739C2-7E86-416C-8B03-3777CFC1DE72.jpeg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>After Lionel Richie's Second Marriage Failed, He Had A Strange And Expensive Relationship With His Ex-Wife</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>After Lionel Richie and his second wife separated, their living arrangements were very odd and expensive for the singer.</span><p>Fans might feel like they need to fact-check after seeing Brenda's birthday post to Sofia, where she wrote, "Happy 25th Birthday to my beautiful Virgo twin daughter.

Commenters are right to be impressed with how Brenda handled the situation, and clearly, things changed after those difficult headlines back in 1988.</p><p>Notably, Brenda doesn't post much about Miles, but that hardly suggests she's not close with him, too. Unlike his sisters, Miles is not in the public eye much, though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miles' mom Diane does post about him on Instagram</a>.</p><p>It's unclear whether Diana and Brenda are on better terms today than they were a few decades ago, but both reportedly attended <a href=#>Sofia Richie's extravagant wedding to Elliot Grainge</a>.</p><p>Either way, the three Richie kids are clearly not short on loving relationships, even if their moms aren't BFFs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmecGrnKeckWK1or7VnrBmqpmYtaqxjKSgnatdobawusSlZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-celebs-you-ll-never-believe-are-actually-worth-peanuts.html><span>←</span><span>15 Celebs You'll Never Believe Are Actually Worth Peanuts</span></a>
