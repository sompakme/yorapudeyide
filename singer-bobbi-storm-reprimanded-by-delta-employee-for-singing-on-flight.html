She also wrote in her comment section that she’s “sang on over 50 flights,” declaring that “there were NO LAWS broken here.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">After going back and forth, the flight leader warned her, “If you’re not able to follow my instructions, you will not be able to take this flight.” Bobbi eventually took her seat, but then proceeded to sing her Gospel song “<a href=# rel=nofollow>We Can’t Forget Him”</a> anyway, as passengers around her listened and awkwardly clapped.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bobbi told passengers that she is “up for two Grammy’s” for featuring on Maverick City Music’s&nbsp;Grammy-nominated album&nbsp;The Maverick Way. She added vocals on the tracks, “Nobody Greater” and “Firm Foundation.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The group has been nominated for Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song for “God Problems” featuring Chandler Moore and Naomi Raine. They are also up for Best Gospel Album.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">It has not been made clear what Bobbi’s second nomination is for, as the credited vocalists on “God Problems” only include Brandon Lake, Maryanne J. George, Ryan Ofei, Noah Schnacky and the aforementioned Moore and Raine. Bobbi’s name also doesn’t appear in the composition or production credits.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Since the incident social media has become divided, with some siding with Delta’s claims of Bobbi disturbing passengers, and others supporting the singer for <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234811762>expressing her excitement.</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m a Christian and a Flight Att. The plane is not a STAGE…God tells us to do things descent & in order…congrats on the Grammy Nomination, but God is a God of order period!,” one person commented as another said, “This is one of the most egotistical things I’ve ever seen. You think because you’re Grammy nominated that rules don’t apply to you and the plane is your stage? Work on that ego sis.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Someone else wrote, “Imagine the entitlement of thinking you are the only one with something that can bless folks and it happens to be in an airplane where they have no choice but to hear you because they can’t go anywhere?!? This is wildly out of pocket sis! You held these people hostage and used God’s name in a manipulative manner.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2-edited.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On the flip side, producer Jazze Pha commented, “congratulations baby girl!!!! u gonna get itttt!!!!!” as someone else said, “Lmao he was trippin nobody was complaining about you except him. What a hater! Keep singing girl!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On Monday (Nov. 13), Delta Airlines released a statement to <a href=# rel=nofollow>USA Today</a> that reads, “Delta has been in contact with the customer. For the safety of our customers and crew, it’s always important to follow crew instructions.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In&nbsp;a follow-up video&nbsp;posted Saturday (Nov. 11), Storm claimed <a href=# data-type=post data-id=568433>Delta apologized</a> to her and also stated that there were “no rules being broken,” on the flight.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In her comments she urged people to not report the flight attendant as she doesn’t want him “to get fired,” but wants him to “learn a valuable lesson on how to treat other people.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e8o67IZqqtp6KierOxz6ugppmembKlecOeo62ZXamurbfIp55mq5mjtKq6xmadpaGXncFufZFsa3FpYmeAcXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./proof-that-taylor-swift-and-tom-hiddleston-were-absolutely-never-meant-to-be.html><span>←</span><span>Proof That Taylor Swift And Tom Hiddleston Were Absolutely Never Meant To Be</span></a>
