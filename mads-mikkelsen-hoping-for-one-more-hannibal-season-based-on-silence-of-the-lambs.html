However, Fuller doesn’t have the rights to Silence of the Lambs, which was owned by MGM at the time Hannibal was being filmed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Arnold Schwarzenegger Set To Star In Netflix Spy Series" href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger Set To Star In Netflix Spy Series</a></span></p><p>"I don't think it's a secret that if it does happen, we would love to go into Silence of the Lambs," Mikkelsen told Indie Wire. "That's always been an issue because they didn't have the rights for that book. But that's obviously the most famous part and we'd love to go in there. We'd obviously switch it around a little and do all kinds of crazy stuff with it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“That story is so interesting and the characters in it are as interesting. We'd switch around the genders and maybe even put two characters into one,” he added. "We would love to find someone to play Buffalo Bill. That's going to be tough. We found a Hannibal, so it's possible. We already used <a href=#>Michael Pitt</a> for Mason and that was fantastic. If he wasn't playing Mason I'd love to see him as Buffalo Bill."</p><p>Pitt was featured in season two of Hannibal as sociopath Mason Verger, the viciously abusive twin brother of Hannibal's patient Margot Verger. Mikkelsen is hoping the series might find a second life on Netflix, where the show has become a big hit. Netflix has successfully revived other <a href=#>series like Lucifer</a> so there’s still hope for fans who’d like to see more of fiction’s most famous cannibal.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>LadBible</a></p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Netflix Renews The Umbrella Academy For 3rd Season" href=#>Netflix Renews The Umbrella Academy For 3rd Season</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmilkZnAbrnIpKKepKOau260zqmgp59dm7yzec6nnGaln6eybrTAp6WimpGherSxwKymp2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./frontier-forum-list-of-frontier-discussions-and-forums.html><span>←</span><span>Frontier Forum List of Frontier Discussions and Forums</span></a>
