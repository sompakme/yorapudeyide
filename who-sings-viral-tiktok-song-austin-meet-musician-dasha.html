Did your ex find out?” Dasha questions an ex-lover in the song’s lyrics. “Where there’s a will then there’s a way and I’m damn sure you lost it / Didn’t even say goodbye / Just wish I knew what caused it.”</p><p>The tune, released in November 2023, tells the story of a relationship gone wrong when one party (Dasha) heads on a planned road trip to Los Angeles while her significant other will “still be here, drunk, washed up in Austin.”</p><p>Thanks to its country vibes, and vengeful lyrics (no song is more popular than one from a woman scorned), the track has reached some major heights on the Spotify U.S. Viral 50 chart.</p><p>‘Austin’ is one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever written. The story behind writing the song is really cool,” she shared in <a href=# rel=noopener>a November 2023 interview</a>. “We were all writing this song called ‘Play Dumb.’ It was like this cheating song about knowing someone’s cheating on you, but playing dumb, so you can hold on a little bit longer, and I didn’t relate to the song, so I was having trouble writing it.”</p><p>She went on to say that after hearing the melody, the song was born. “I started freestyling over it, and I started the chorus for ‘Austin’… exactly how you hear it.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for everything to know about Dasha as her song continues to go viral:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Who-Sings-the-Viral-Song-%E2%80%98Austin-5-Things-to-Know-About-TikTok-Star-%E2%80%94-And-Singer-%E2%80%94-Dasha-3.jpg><h3>1.

In 2020, she decided to leave school behind and move to Los Angeles.</p><p>“I decided I was going to dropout, and move to L.A. because during 2020, I had started posting my songs to TikTok and I had a few viral videos, which was awesome,” she shared in the same November 2023 interview. “It got me my management. It just felt right at the time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Who-Sings-the-Viral-TikTok-Song-Austin-5-Things-to-Know-About-the-Singer-Dasha-3.jpeg><h3>2.
