He attempted to avoid the paparazzi as he exited his vehicle to go inside the court. Harry’s wife <a href=# rel=nofollow>Meghan Markle</a> wasn’t photographed with him. She’s presumably in Los Angeles with their two children, as Meghan avoided returning to the UK last month for King Charles’ coronation amid a strained relationship with the royal family.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Harry & Meghan's 'Near Catastrophic' Car Crash Isn't Covered By Their Royal Protection, Here's Why</a></span></p><h2 id=why-prince-harry-is-suing-the-daily-mirror-publisher>Why Prince Harry Is Suing The Daily Mirror Publisher</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar52790047.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harry and Meghan’s troubled relationship with the royals wasn’t the only reason they decided to abdicate their royal duties and relocate to North America in 2021. The famous couple also allege that the British media made living in the UK a nightmare for their family.</p><p>This is evidence by Harry’s ongoing lawsuit against the Daily Mirror publisher, Mirror Group Newspaper The prince is <a href=# rel=nofollow>one of four people who claim the Daily Mirror hacked</a> their voicemails to get intimate details about their personal lives.</p><p>However, he’s also launched two other lawsuits, one against News Group Newspapers (which publishes The Sun) and Associated Newspapers Ltd., which owns the Daily Mail and Mail, over similar allegations.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Why Critics Still Haven't Forgiven Prince Harry For Slapping Taylor Hawkins</a></span></p><p>Other celebrities have joined Harrys’ legal battle, with actor Hugh Grant making similar claims in the News Group lawsuit, and Elizabeth Hurley is involved in the Associated Newspapers case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So far, the publishers have argued the cases should be thrown out, since the plaintiffs failed to file the complaint within the legal six-year time limit. However, the plaintiffs’ legal teams argue an exception should be made, since the publishers concealed evidence to prevent their alleged illegal activities from coming to light.</p><h2 id=prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-could-soon-end-up-in-divorce-court>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Could Soon End Up In Divorce Court</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-he-invictus-games-park-in-the-hague.jpg><p>Given the ongoing lawsuits, Prince Harry will likely spend a large chunk of his upcoming time in a court room. But he may be fighting in court for a different reason, too, as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">he and Meghan Markle may be headed for divorce</a>.</p><p>Various reports allege that the duo have both hired divorce lawyers. Speaking to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sky News</a>, sources alleges the couple hired counsel “months ago.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, Paul Burrell – who worked as Princess Diana’s butler until her death in 1997 – has said he believes the divorce rumors, adding his belief Harry has only stayed with Meghan so long for the sake of their two kids.</p><p>“Am I the only person in the UK that is thinking, has Harry finally woken up to the truth?” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Burrell said to GB News.</a> “Has he finally seen the truth of what his wife is doing and that he’s been brainwashed and mesmerised by her beauty or something? Because we all know that, but he doesn’t seem to see it.”</p><p>Harry and Meghan reportedly didn’t sign a prenup before their 2018 wedding. With a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">net worth of at least $60 million</a> between the two of them, dividing their assets may become complicated should they indeed proceed with divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinq6GemLJutMCrqbJlo528uL%2BMrqdmrJ9isLDB0a1kmqWZmXqzsc%2Boqa2rXZ2ybrnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55koaGimrFusMivpqublWK5osPYnqmsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./long-lines-facebook-and-affiliate-summit-west.html><span>←</span><span>Long Lines, Facebook and Affiliate Summit West</span></a>
