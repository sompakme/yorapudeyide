Following that, we will reveal what West said to Vulture about how the cast did and did not come to his aid regarding their breakup. Then, everyone's most asked question will be answered... Will Ciara and West get back together?

After Summer House Season 8, Ciara Miller and West Wilson's relationship came to a crashing end.</p><p>According to RealityTea, West Wilson and Ciara Miller broke up in December 2023 and stopped being in contact after that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Ciara Miller and West Wilson were reportedly not in contact after their breakup</strong></a>, fans were curious about any build-up to their June 2024 reunion on Summer House. During a revealing interview with Vulture, West confirmed the last time he and Ciara spoke prior to their tense reunion on the show.</p><p>"[It's been] five or six months. The weirdest thing with this playing out now is it was all last year. You see how things felt for other people when we’re already super-far removed. The backlash you get."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/summer-hosue-cast-west-wilson-interview.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the first part of the reunion, <strong>Ciara said to West, "You got everything you wanted out of me, and I got the bare minimum.” </strong>In his interview with Vulture, West responded to how it felt to hear those words. In short, he was "hurt".</p><p>"That’s hurtful, but we were always on the same page during filming," West explained to Vulture.</p><p>"It didn’t end when she wanted. She wanted more."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Untitled-design-(2)-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Ciara And Austen's Messy Summer House Love Triangle Explained">Ciara And Austen's Messy Summer House Love Triangle Explained</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Austen Kroll's messy entanglement with Ciara Miller has always been filled with drama.</p><p>While Jesse Solomon was quick to come to West's defense during the reunion part 1, Paife, Amanda, and, of course, Ciara, pounced on him. They didn't buy his reasoning that <strong>the pair had a "fun summer together, and people break up"</strong>. According to West, <strong>Jesse is the only Summer House cast member to come to his defense on or off-camera</strong>. Still, West believes he still has positive relationships with the rest of the cast. This, in the fans' minds, is highly debatable...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After all, both Paige and Amanda put West in his place at the start of the new season of Summer House. West did his best to confront them about their accusations regarding his lack of commitment to Ciara. His response on the reunion show is something he regrets:</p><p>"There are 9 million things I wish I said that I didn’t. Frankly, I did a horrible job explaining. I was nervous, and if I could do it again, I would try to respond to other people less.

But at the same time, I am the reason it played out that way and I hurt someone else’s feelings. I don’t want to bash someone or fight to the death to get my side of the story out for someone whose feelings I hurt."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reality star continued by saying that <strong>he did care about his relationship with Ciara,</strong> but that it just ran its course. He claimed that he would deal with what the rest of the cast said to him as well as the fan perception.</p><p>"This experience opened the door to me to see the effects of these relationships on other people. Things may be more serious than I perceive them, and the ramifications of that are clearly a big deal."</p><h2 id=do-west-wilson-and-ciara-want-to-get-back-together>Do West Wilson And Ciara Want To Get Back Together?</h2><p>In a clip from June 13th, 2024's Summer House Reunion part 2, West Wilson is seen apologizing to Ciara Miller. His apology opened up the door for fans to start wondering if the pair would ever consider getting back together. Here's what West said:</p><p>"My feelings were genuine. I think I just expressed myself maybe too late after it was too late to figure things out. But I'm sorry, overall, for hurting you. Obviously, it's still painful. It's painful for me too ... It's my fault.

She also claimed that she wasn't sure if people were even capable of changing that much. Finally, she said that she wasn't holding her breath for anyone. But when asked if she still had feeling for West, Ciara responded...</p><p>"Yeah, of course."</p><p>This <strong>prompted West to also admit his feelings for Ciara</strong>: "I mean, same, but I didn't expect to hear that if I'm being honest."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-truth-about-josh-popper-s-life-after-his-appearance-on-bravo-s-summer-house.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="From Dating Madonna To Boxing, Josh Popper Has Transformed His Life After His Appearance On Bravo's Summer House">From Dating Madonna To Boxing, Josh Popper Has Transformed His Life After His Appearance On Bravo's Summer House</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Josh Popper made a brief cameo on the dramatic reality series Summer House and fans should know these things about him, including who he's dating.</p><p>However, when asked about the possibility of getting back together with Ciara during an interview with Vulture, West said it was unlikely:</p><p>"I would never say “no” to that. There’s always a chance. But we’re on our own paths right now. It’s for the best, and I hope we can be friends at some point."</p><p>West went on to claim that he feels that he's learned a great deal from his relationship with Ciara. And that jumping back into bed with her again may not be the best idea. He also has received a ton of negative feedback to the breakup and doesn't want to make matters worse.</p><h2 id=why-did-ciara-and-west-wilson-break-up>Why Did Ciara And West Wilson Break Up?</h2><p>The Summer House reunion proved to West Wilson that his breakup with Ciara Miller was different than the perception he had of it previously. During an interview with Vulture, West pulled the curtain back on the reason the pair went their separate ways. At least <strong>from his perspective, their breakup was mutual.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Our breakup felt more mutual in real time than it turned out to be on reunion day. Ciara’s reaction was a lot different than I had interpreted. When we stopped talking, it felt like a mature conversation. We agreed on a lot of things, and it was emotional but it didn’t feel like she had that much animosity toward me.'</p><p>West went on to admit, "You never want to see someone who you care about get their feelings hurt, but that’s not how I thought it played out in real life at all."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/summer-hosue-cast-west-wilson-and-ciara-miller-poster.jpg><p>However, both Ciara and West have been pretty cagey about the real reason why they broke up. All we really know from Ciara is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>West "couldn't commit"</strong></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the pair started their relationship on Summer House, it continued off-screen. This is something that West claimed was hard to "coexist" with. Ultimately, West wanted to end things and believed Ciara did too. But, according to the reunion, this wasn't true.<strong> Ciara claimed "He was ready to go to the next bar, and I went home crying."</strong></p><p>Clearly, there are some missing pieces that Summer House fans are yet to discover...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/04/summer-house-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Summer House</h5>TV-14Reality <strong>Release Date</strong> <span>January 9, 2017</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span>Kyle Cooke , Lindsay Hubbard , Stephen McGee , Carl Radke , Jaclyn Shuman , Everett Weston , Ashley Wirkus , Lauren Wirkus</span> <strong>Seasons</strong> <span>7</span> <strong>Network</strong> <span>Bravo</span> <strong>Franchise(s)</strong> <span>Summer House</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiunqukYsSquNKopWabmZa%2FonnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkrK2dorKzeceorKydXaeytrrIqKVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-sad-truth-about-jazz-jennings-weight-gain.html><span>←</span><span>The Sad Truth About Jazz Jennings Weight Gain</span></a>
