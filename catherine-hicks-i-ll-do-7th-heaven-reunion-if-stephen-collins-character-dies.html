The actress joked that she wants <a href=#><b>Stephen Collins</b></a>‘ character, Rev. Eric Camden, to be killed off.</p><p>“We would have to open with Stephen’s coffin,” Hicks, 65, told <a href=#>TMZ</a> cameras on Monday, September 26.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“It’s all up to the networks and those types of things. I think we’d all love to be together,” she added. “Eighth Heaven with a new boyfriend for Annie.”</p><p>Collins, 68, played Hicks’ TV husband on the beloved WB family drama for 11 seasons from 1996 to 2007. (Watch them in &nbsp;a scene together in the clip above!) In 2014, <a href=#>TMZ<i> </i>released a recording</a> of Collins admitting to sexually abusing young girls in the past. The audio was taped during a 2012 therapy session that he had with his estranged wife, Faye Grant.</p><p><a href=#>Collins opened up about the incidents</a> during an interview with <b>Katie Couric</b>, which aired on December 19, 2014. “In 1973, there were two occasions when I exposed myself to this young woman. Several months later, she came to visit and stay with us, with my first wife and me. My wife had gone to sleep, and she and I were watching TV alone together … I knew that something unthinkably wrong had just happened that I couldn’t take back,” he recalled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I had put that stuff behind me,” he added. “I’m a flawed person. In the church, it’s actually one of the things I love about the church… It’s really one of the main things about the Christian faith, is you know, Christ said in so many ways, ‘Bring me that… which about you is broken, bring it,’ and most people are broken in some way.”</p><p>Back in February, the<i> 7th Heaven</i> cast — minus Collins — reunited. Hicks, <a href=#><b>Jessica Biel</b></a>, <b>Beverley Mitchell</b>, <b>Barry Watson </b><a href=#>and <b>Mackenzie Rosman</b></a> posed for a photo together while eating at <a href=#>Biel’s Au Fudge restaurant</a> in West Hollywood.</p><p>Biel, 34, and Mitchell, 35, have remained particularly close. Last week, Biel, who married <b>Justin Timberlake</b> in 2012, shared a cute throwback photo of the two from set.</p><p>“They are so cute! My little girls — [they’re family],” Hicks said of the pic on Monday. “I don’t worry about them. They’re happy, they’re good. We get together. It’s really nice.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqarJiav6q6xGafopubqHqquMtmm6hlZ6m1brTEmq2epl2nsra6yKilZqGWYsC1sc%2BhnKdlk6S5rbXNrGScoJGnrqTAxKtknaGVqHq4gJNrZ3FqXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bonnie-wright-always-knew-her-ginny-weasley-wouldn-t-be-received-well.html><span>←</span><span>Bonnie Wright Always Knew Her Ginny Weasley Wouldn't Be Received Well</span></a>
