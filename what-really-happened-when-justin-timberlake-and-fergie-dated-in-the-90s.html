Justin Timberlake was only 16 years old, while Fergie was 24 when they got together. Years later, the Black Eyed Peas singer said she didn’t know what she was thinking dating the NSYNC singer.</p><h2 id=what-happened-during-justin-timberlake-rsquo-s-relationship-with-fergie>What Happened During Justin Timberlake’s Relationship With Fergie?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_2823.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Things were rocky when Justin Timberlake and the rest of the members began the band. NSYNC wasn’t topping the charts immediately, and they had to work hard to get their music out there. Still, as the members were gaining popularity in the industry, their dating lives also started to pick up. J.C Chasez was dating one of Fergie’s friends in 1996, and that is how Fergie ended up meeting Justin Timberlake.</p><p>Fergie spoke to Cosmopolitan about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">meeting Timberlake</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> and what they did when they hung out.</a> “One of my good friends was dating J.C Chasez, so we’d all hang out with NSYNC. Justin and I would go out together and have fun and make out.” Among the things Fergie and Timberlake would do during their relationship was travel together. The former couple went to Hawaii together, but Fergie insists it was only a relationship for convenience. She added, “We were never serious. He was Mr. Right Now.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Fergie was asked about her relationship with Justin Timberlake in 2017, she was visibly uncomfortable. Andy Cohen asked the Big Girls Don’t Cry singer all about her romance during an episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. “It wasn’t all that serious. Am I allowed to pass on this? Pass. Plead the fifth.”</p><p>After their relationship, Fergie dated and married Shotgun Wedding actor Josh Duhamel, and they share a son, 10-year-old, Axl Jack. Duhamel and Fergie separated in 2017 and finalized their divorce two years later.</p><p>While Justin Timberlake married actress Jessica Biel, and the couple have two children together, Silas, 8 and Phineas, 3. The two keep their marriage and children out of the public eye as much as they can to maintain their privacy.</p><p>Since Justin Timberlake and Fergie's relationship was decades ago, the musicians hardly discuss the topic of their brief romance that ended in 1997.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=after-justin-timberlake-and-fergie-39-s-relationship-justin-dated-britney-spears>After Justin Timberlake And Fergie's Relationship, Justin Dated Britney Spears</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar41784890.jpg><p>Two years after Justin Timberlake and Fergie's relationship, Timberlake began his now-infamous relationship with Britney Spears in 1999.</p><p>From his NSYNC days to his successful solo career, Justin Timberlake dated several beautiful women, including Charmed’s Alyssa Milano, Fergie, Britney Spears, and <strong><a href=#>Cameron Diaz.</a></strong> But it was his relationship with Britney Spears that was most notable.</p><p>The ultimate '90s couple went their separate ways though, when Justin Timberlake reportedly broke up with Britney Spears with a text after<a href=#> Spears allegedly cheated</a> on him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britney Spears’ former video director, Chris Applebaum, revealed what Timberlake told the singer while she was on set. The Toxic singer was in between a 24-hour shoot for the Overprotected (Darkchild Remix) video when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she received the text, “It’s over,” from Timberlake.</a> Applebaum told PageSix that Spears was shocked at the move, but he convinced her to get back on set and show Justin “he was making the biggest mistake of his life.”</p><p>In her memoir, Woman In Me, Spears recalled being devastated after receiving the breakup text. “For as much as Justin hurt me, there was a huge foundation of love, and when he left me, I was devastated,” Britney explained; she could barely speak for months, and whenever anyone asked her about Timberlake, she would cry. “I don’t know If I was clinically in shock, but it felt that way.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/your-paragraph-text-18.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Mila Kunis Requested A Body-Double For Her Scenes With Justin Timberlake In Friends With Benefits And She Was Completely Right</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Mila Kunis requested a change to certain scenes alongside Justin Timberlake in Friends With Benefits.</span><p>The singer added she barely left the house, and as a result, her career began to suffer. Spears even considered permanently moving back to Louisiana and quitting Hollywood. When Justin Timberlake flew to visit her at home with a letter that read, “I can’t breathe without you,” she still couldn’t get out of the trance the breakup text had put her in.</p><p>In the memoir, she explained, “It almost felt like I was suffocating, like I couldn’t breathe after all that had happened. He did all that; he came there to see me, and I still couldn’t talk to him or to anybody.”</p><h2 id=justin-timberlake-and-fergie-are-also-connected-through-mickey-mouse-club>Justin Timberlake And Fergie Are Also Connected Through Mickey Mouse Club</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fergie-10.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Justin Timberlake began his career appearing on Disney’s The All-New Mickey Mouse Club alongside celebrities like <strong><a href=#>Britney Spears</a></strong>, Christina Aguilera and <strong><a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a></strong>. Being a part of the popular '90s show gave Timberlake a large fan base at an early age, so everyone knew who he was, including the ladies.</p><p>Like Timberlake, Fergie started her career at the Disney Channel long before Timberlake joined the show. The London Bridge singer started working there when she was ten and left in 1989. Fergie, who was still going by her original name, Stacy Ann, went on to join the '90’s girl group Wild Orchid. Aside from Fergie, the group’s members included Kids Incorporated’s Renee Sands and The Great Pretenders star Stefanie Ridel.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Untitled-design-55.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The All-New Mickey Mouse Club Cast Ranked By Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>See which former cast member is the richest.</span><p>Though Fergie and Timberlake got their start as Mickey Mouse Club performers, they weren’t romantically linked until after he moved on into music. Timberlake joined JC Chasez, Joey Fatone, Lance Bass, and Chris Kirkpatrick to form the '90s boy band NSYNC. The group was formed in 1995, and by 2000, they were topping the charts in several countries with their hit album, No Strings Attached.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihrquknrtuwMimmZ6qnJa4pnnFnqmgoZViv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxecOeq5qhnKh6o7HFqKmeZZKntrW6xLJkrKiVlr%2B0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./subaru-outback-forum-list-of-subaru-outback-discussions-and-forums.html><span>←</span><span>Subaru Outback Forum List of Subaru Outback Discussions and Forums</span></a>
