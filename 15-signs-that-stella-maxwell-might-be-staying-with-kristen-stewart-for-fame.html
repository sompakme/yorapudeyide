We’re honestly surprised we haven’t heard more about her until recently. But in light of their relationship together, their names have been under a spotlight for quite a while now. We want to explore more about this mysterious supermodel girlfriend that Kristen Stewart has been in love with, we all deserve some insight!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Grazia Daily,&nbsp;<a href=#>she grew up in Belgium</a> and she oddly enough has a very similar grungy style to Stewart, while we don’t know a ton of details as to how they met and fell in love, we do want to dive in deep to find out whether or not Stella Maxwell is staying with Kristen Stewart just for the fame. Full disclosure, these are opinions from the majority of fans, and we completely respect these two individuals, we’re just having a bit of fun with all the endless possibilities there could be.</p><p>From the constant paparazzi to the fact that they’re always together seemingly 24/7, their relationship is right there in the open being watched by everyone, yet they never reveal much about the relationship they have together. Despite having a platform to support the LGBT community, they stay quiet for the most part when it comes to their relationship, but who knows, maybe this will change in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-paparazzi-constantly-follows-them>The Paparazzi Constantly Follows Them</h2><p>Stella Maxwell might be a bit more mysterious than most celebrities on the entertainment radar, but she is very photogenic, hence her career as a model. This has also led many to believe that this is another reason why she’s always around Kristen Stewart when they go out on the town—because paparazzi follow them around literally everywhere they go. There are tons of photos of them together to prove it. Maybe this is why Stella Maxwell likes dating Kristen Stewart.</p><p><strong>Since dating Kristen, she’s always getting glam paparazzi shots whenever they leave their home!</strong></p><p>With spending much of her time in LA and NYC, there are tons of agencies that want to photograph them together as often as possible, which is quite odd because there isn’t even that much drama involved in either of their lives. While Stella Maxwell has built a career of her own, these paparazzi shots definitely don’t hurt her reputation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-drama-surrounding-kristen>The Drama Surrounding Kristen</h2><p>While there isn’t a ton of drama surrounding their relationship together as a whole, there is some drama with Kristen Stewart for many different reasons. Maybe this is why Stella Maxwell tends to latch on— because she might want the attention from all the drama her girlfriend receives. Kristen Stewart seems to always be in and out of the drama magazines because of her career, how she acts, how aggressive she is, or even because she doesn’t smile enough apparently for some people.</p><p><strong>They’ve both had&nbsp;relationships with other women in the industry, but because of the name Kristen Stewart has made for herself, anyone she dates is bound to be thrown into the spotlight with her. This might bring a certain appeal to some individuals looking for more fame.</strong></p><p>We, of course, don’t know if this is the drive behind their relationship by any means, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be a possibility.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-kristen-good-with-kids>Is Kristen Good With Kids?</h2><p>While neither of them currently have children, they seem to both care very much about each other and the future they could possibly have together. Many have said that Kristen Stewart might be cold to the press, but she seems like a very warm and loving person towards those she cares about.</p><p><strong>They’ve both been known for their down to earth personalities, which has led them both to have a very seemingly close relationship together.</strong></p><p>Maybe this will mean they are finally ready to settle down, that’s sure to <a href=#>spark more headlines, that’s for sure</a>! It’s also a possibility that they’ve both been planning the future together in terms of adoption, but this is all speculation based on what we know about their relationship currently! We can only hope so because they would probably make fantastic parents according to the majority of fans. What are your thoughts on their future together?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-share-a-love-of-travel>They Share A Love Of Travel</h2><p>Because of Stella Maxwell’s career and the work that Kristen Stewart focuses on, they’re always traveling coast to coast, while they seem to never leave each other’s side, they do often seem to be very happy whenever they travel, but that also makes you think. Is there a possibility of Stella Maxwell using Stewart for travel and seeing more of the world? While this might be unlikely, you can’t help but wonder, not only because the industry is full of people who only want to better themselves, but also because there are just some bad people in this world in general and they just want to use as many people as they can. We highly doubt this is the case and it’s all speculation, but when two people are in the unique position they’re in right now, people start to spread rumors and you can’t help but listen to a few of them!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-backup-plan-for-kristen>The Backup Plan For&nbsp;Kristen</h2><p>Stella Maxwell <a href=#>previously dated Miley Cyrus</a>, according to The Sun. Yes, you read that right! That’s a pretty tough act to follow, Miley Cyrus is wild and outgoing, always the life of the party, and full of drama. If someone happened to be in a relationship with her, you can’t help but wonder if that’s also who that person is as well, that kind of drama feeding individual. While Kristen Stewart has a much more quiet life, it is curious as to why the relationship between Stella Maxwell and Kristen Stewart came to be. What really brought them together, when all Stella Maxwell seems attracted to is the drama? Does Kristen Stewart actually have that sense of drama that Maxwell is looking for? Either way, we can only hope that with either of these women, they aren’t just using each other as a second choice. Do you think Stella Maxwell is the backup plan?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stella-is-copying-her-fashion-style>Stella Is Copying&nbsp;Her Fashion Style</h2><p><a href=#>Stella Maxwell is constantly wearing designer outfits</a> on the runway or during photo shoots, but when she’s seen side by side with Kristen Stewart, she’s seemed to pick up a much more relaxed vibe that is not very common for many supermodels, especially Victoria’s Secret models. Maybe she’s enjoying the fact that Kristen Stewart’s style is much more grungy and tomboyish, and maybe she likes being able to just be casual and not really worry about her appearance as much? While we might never know the truth, that’s sure what it looks like.</p><p><strong>Some might say they don’t have the best sense of style, but you can’t deny that they do have a style that has seemed to grow on one another.</strong></p><p>Honestly, they probably even share clothes when they’re too lazy to come up with their own look! Do you like the grungy style Stella Maxwell has developed or do you like the high fashion looks more?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-seem-to-lead-a-laid-back-life>They Seem To Lead A Laid Back Life</h2><p>Similar to the topic of fashion above, it seems as if the relationship between Stella Maxwell and Kristen Stewart tends to be very laid back. While this might not be the driving force of their relationship, it does seem like something that could potentially attract them to one another. Whether it’s because they both want a break from the mainstream drama or they want to cause drama due to them falling out of the mainstream standards in the industry, either way, they’ve caused a stir of rumors as we all know because of their relationship together. According to The Sun, many have come to believe that Stella Maxwell is <a href=#>no longer with Miley Cyrus</a> because she wanted a more laid back girlfriend that also has enough drama surrounding her that it would still bring her recognition. While this seems to fit the narrative very well, of course, nothing is confirmed since they’re so private about their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-they-trying-to-get-other-people-jealous>Are They Trying To Get Other People Jealous?</h2><p>Both Stella Maxwell and Kristen Stewart have gained some serious drama and applause for the past relationships they’ve had with other women in the industry. But this has also caused some&nbsp;drama&nbsp;because many fans have said that they seem to only be dating because they just want the attention. But many others have speculated that they got together both as a failsafe plan to get back at their ex’s. This isn’t too far fetched, they both have come from very well known relationships, and not too long after they both broke&nbsp;off their last relationships, they got together in the relationship they’re in now. Who knows, they could really be in love, but you can’t help but wonder if this is just some ploy to get back at their past relationships, showing everyone they can still do better and date someone else who's famous! What are your thoughts, which will you believe?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-remain-a-mystery-couple>They Remain A Mystery Couple</h2><p>We all know a bit of mystery causes so much more drama and rumors floating around on the internet and in the tabloids. While they always seem to go out of <a href=#>their way to have lunch</a> and go to the store together, as noted by gossip sites like Just Jared, not much else is known about their relationship together. They seem close from the outside simply because they’re always together, but in general, they’re known as a bit of a mystery. This mystery couple might even thrive on the fact that people are constantly keeping them relevant because all of the media outlets are craving an answer and constantly write about their relationship in the hopes that the couple might eventually crack under the pressure from fans and the media. But so far they haven’t cracked under the immense pressure and they continue to go about their day to day life, running errands and sporting cozy clothes we all want to borrow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matching-outfits-for-attention>Matching Outfits For Attention</h2><p>Have you ever thought that they might share the same style because they just want the <a href=#>attention they get from the paparazzi?</a> While matching outfits might be a minor detail to point out, it wouldn’t be absurd to think that the details matter, especially when the paparazzi are constantly taking your picture while you’re with your girlfriend. You can’t help but wonder that maybe they want to cause more drama from the tabloids because they constantly share clothes and wear similar outfits! Maybe they’re just being comfortable when they go out, maybe they have the same sense of style, or maybe it’s all just a ploy to snag more headlines as often as Stella Maxwell can, we might never know, but the fans sure keep mentioning it constantly online! If only we could just reach out to them and get the truth for everyone, then we wouldn’t have to guess about their fashion style and rumored fame using tendencies!!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-stella-sticking-with-kristen-to-grow-her-career>Is Stella Sticking With Kristen To Grow Her Career?</h2><p>Stella Maxwell simply isn’t as well-known as the Twilight actress, Kristen Stewart, so is it that hard to imagine that Maxwell might want to grow her career while also being in love? Does that make her a bad person? People, in general, are constantly looking for ways to better their tomorrow and their future in general.&nbsp;As the Daily Mail points out, why would it be that much of a stretch to imagine that Stella Maxwell might be using her relationships as a way to <a href=#>promote her own career?</a>&nbsp;We aren’t doubting they’re in love, but we can’t disprove that there might be some kind of ulterior motive involved in the relationship in some way or another. Of course, this being unconfirmed doesn’t prove anything, but it also doesn’t prove they are in love with each other either. If this is how Stella Maxwell wants to grow her career, who are we to judge!?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=doing-a-lot-for-their-shared-community>Doing A Lot For Their Shared Community</h2><p>We all know by now that bi and gay relationships that occur in the celebrity universe get a ton of attention. While we completely believe that when someone chooses to date whoever they want that’s up to them and we would never think that someone is just doing that for fame, but it is something worth mentioning purely because many have speculated that this is why Stella Maxwell is with Kristen Stewart. No matter how you look at it, <a href=#>their relationship seems to have come out of the blue</a>, as noted by the Daily Mail. Many don’t even know how they met other than mutual friends and past relationships. Because they’re so private with their relationship, it’s caused many people to wonder and not fully understand exactly why they’re together. They are hardly ever even seen being affectionate towards one another, which is another reason as to why many people are having a serious fit over their sexuality and everything in between.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-go-everywhere-together>They Go Everywhere Together</h2><p>Because they go everywhere together, many individuals have concluded this must be because Stella Maxwell wants as much exposure as possible. Stella Maxwell still has a long way to go to hold fame for herself on her own, which is why she might tag along with Kristen Stewart every chance she gets.</p><p><strong>While they have been dating for a few years now, we hardly know anything about their relationship. This has caused so much negative speculation there’s no way they can escape it at this point, unless they both decided to be more open&nbsp;about their relationship with their fame and the public around them.</strong></p><p>Until then, many can just expect that this couple will be under the spotlight, trying to dissect the relationship from a different perspective. Perhaps they are just mutually using each other for fame, who knows what to expect from these two!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-feed-off-each-other-s-fame>They Feed Off Each Other’s Fame</h2><p>According to the Daily Mail, the two women were<a href=#> caught kissing</a> back in the first month of 2017, where they were caught on camera in the back of a car, and they’ve supposedly been dating since then, but it makes you wonder if the gossip and tabloids kind of forced them to be together because they got caught when they didn’t think anyone would see. Maybe this has caused them to stay together for the drama of it all and that’s it.</p><p><strong>It wouldn’t be hard to imagine that some celebrities in the industry come together on a mutual basis just to spark&nbsp;gossip and entertainment!</strong></p><p>We’re sure that many individuals have come together just as friends to push a narrative of a relationship that doesn’t even exist. They could just be feeding off of each other’s fame until their relationship isn’t relevant anymore, then they could hypothetically break up and cause more drama! Let’s hope this isn’t the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-needs-more-support-for-her-career>She Needs More Support For Her Career</h2><p>Stella Maxwell,<a href=#>&nbsp;dated Miley Cyrus back in 2015</a>, we mentioned this briefly before, but it’s important to add that they might not have lasted for a very long time due to the fact that Miley Cyrus was so focused on her career and what she planned for the future, it was all about her and her only, at least from an outside perspective.</p><p><strong>Maybe Stella Maxwell fell in love with Kristen Stewart because her fame was a bit more low-key and she wasn’t as outgoing as Miley Cyrus.</strong></p><p>Maybe this made a light bulb go off for Stella Maxwell, propelling her to pursue this relationship so she could be the one in the spotlight instead. While this all seems a bit too intricate, we can’t rule it out as a potential possibility, especially since this relationship seems to have bettered her career overall for the long run as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, do you think Stella Maxwell is just using Kristen Stewart?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWLAqrPNrGStoJGperTAxKWjmmWdlsW4sculZKahl53Bbq7EZqqtmameu6h51qKroWWbp7a0wMSnZKyslayus8CMn6arZZaWuqZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hawks-announcer-bob-rathbun-suffers-scary-medical-emergency-on-air-h.html><span>←</span><span> Hawks Announcer Bob Rathbun Suffers Scary Medical Emergency On Air, H</span></a>
