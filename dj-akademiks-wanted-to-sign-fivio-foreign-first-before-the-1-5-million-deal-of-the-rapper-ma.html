The revelation caused a bit of controversy after it was suggested that Fivio received a $5,000 advance from Mase but Mase later explained that when he helped the rapper get his record deal, he received a hefty check. Later came international stardom as a leading rapper in the New York Drill scene.</p><p>Fivio Foreign and Ma$e are clashing over contractual disputes, but Akademiks says that if he had stretched his bank account and struck a huge deal, these disputes wouldn't be happening.</p><p><a href=#>According to VladTV on Youtube</a>, Akademiks said he has a deal with a label to sign artists, and he once had his sights set on Fivio.</p><p>DJ Akademiks added that he had "an <a href=#>experience with that situation</a>." He said, "So, I had a joint venture label where I sign artists, I still sign artists but new artists are too much and make too much money not dealing with it so why even do a deal with a bunch of demons, right? But anyway, I was trying to look into signing a couple of artists and I remember at the time, Fivio was poppin'."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In summer 2019, the breakout single "Big Drip" by Fivio made him a hot commodity on the New York drill rap scene. Ak says he talked with his lawyer about potentially reeling in Fivio.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Bling-Bling: The History of Hip-Hop Jewelry</b></a></span></p><p>DJ Akademiks eventually got word that Ma$e and his RichFish label wanted no less than $1 million to join forces to sign the rapper -- and while he backed off, Columbia Records jumped in with $1.5 mil to sweeten the deal.</p><p>Akademiks claim that Ma$e signed with Fivio over his fears of losing the rapper to Suge Knight, but he now believes it was really Ma$e's celebrity that prompted him to sign.</p><p>According to the terms of their contract, Ma$e gets 50% of Fivio's earnings. This is a standard in a 50/50 deal that leads to bigger payouts for Ma$e as Fivio's status grows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fivio and Ma$e have publicly dissed one another with their various sides of the story, and Ak says Fivio's just about due for a new deal where he could get upward of $5 million.</p><p>When Fivio signs on a new dotted line, he finds that money can indeed buy happiness.</p><p>Akademiks claimed that he did not see much movement around Fivio other than a buzz, so he stepped in.</p><p>"I hit my lawyer and I said, 'Yo, I wanna sign this guy.' Now, I said, 'Yo, we gotta probably reach out and get some meetings and I guess my lawyer knew someone who was a direct contact to his lawyer and they got in touch. Now, granted, I had no idea <a href=#>Mase</a> was in this situation 'til he came back and said, 'Well, he does have a situation with Mase,' and I'm like, 'Is he still looking for a deal?' He said, 'Yes, he <a href=#>still is looking for a deal</a> .'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Akademiks told Fivio that his lawyer had warned him against accepting a $1.5 million deal with Columbia Records, and he bowed out of negotiations. Akademiks thought he was going to be able to squeeze by with half a million dollars, but he applauded Mase's value because Fivio ended up with a reported $1.5 million dollar deal with Columbia Records.</p><p>"I don't think [Fivio] gets that deal without <a href=#>Mase</a> ," Akademiks added. "Do I think he gets a deal? Absolutely, but is it that value? No."</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:<a href=#> ‘NBA Star’ Dennis Rodman’s Youngest Daughter Trinity Rodman Becomes The Highest Paid Player In National Women’s Soccer League</a></b></span></p><p>Sources:<a href=#> hnhh</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>VladTV</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxq3nApJidnZ2euLR51pqlrZ2UYsGwedKinqdllp7DqruMn6arnZmcu26yyKuqrWWSmrOwvsRmq6GdXWZ6dnnMoqOloZ%2BjeqWxwKVkqJ5dqbWmedGap6mdomK6orHSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-crane-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>David Crane Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
