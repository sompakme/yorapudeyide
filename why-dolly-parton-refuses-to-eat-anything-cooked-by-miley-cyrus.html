If only Aunt Dolly could be everyone's fairy godmother 🥲"</p><p><a href=#>As Cyrus' godmother</a>, Parton has indeed been supportive of her career, especially amid the controversies related to <a href=#>her relationship with Liam Hemsworth</a>.</p><p>In December 2022, the Hannah Montana alum even shared that the <a href=#>ten-time Guinness World record holder</a> "clutched her pearls" when she said she was going brunette. "I've never seen Dolly actually scared before. She acted like I told her the worst news you can imagine," Cyrus said of Parton's reaction.</p><p>"She clutched her pearls, gasped, and went back and she goes, 'You can't do that. You are me,'" she continued. But when it comes to food, the two are certainly not the same person. The country singer won't even eat anything cooked by the Flowers hitmaker. Here's why.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Remember That Time Sinead O'Connor Wrote An Open Letter To Miley Cyrus?</a></span></p><h2 id=dolly-parton-on-being-miley-cyrus-39-godmother>Dolly Parton On Being Miley Cyrus' Godmother</h2><p>Parton knew that she had to be Cyrus' godmother the moment she came along. "I worked with Billy Ray for all those years, when he had Achy Breaky Heart," the Jolene songstress recalled in a 2019 interview with SiriusXM's Just Jenny. "He worked with me on some shows we did in the early days. He opened some of my shows. We just got to know each other."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fmuwtkcxoaehajb.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added: "I wrote a song called Romeo, and had him in a video. We just kind of gelled, 'cause we're both country kids. We had a lot of fun just talking about that. And then when Miley came along, I said, 'She's got to be my fairy goddaughter.'" That same year, Parton told People that she'd "rather live an example" than constantly give life advice to Cyrus.</p><p>"[I'd rather] be an example rather than just try to tell somebody to do this, do that because I don't think that's right," she explained. "Everybody's different. You've got your own journey. And some people are going to help you along the way and they can kick a few rocks out of the road for you, but you got to walk it."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Dolly Parton And Elvis Presley?</a></span></p><h2 id=dolly-parton-is-releasing-her-first-rock-album-featuring-miley-cyrus>Dolly Parton Is Releasing Her First Rock Album Featuring Miley Cyrus</h2><p>In May 2023, Parton announced the complete roster of artists featured on her upcoming first rock album, Rockstar. It includes the likes of Elton John, Sting, Steven Tyler, Stevie Nicks, Lizzo, and of course, her goddaughter Cyrus. A statement on her website read: "Dolly Parton has joined forces with some of Rock music's most legendary artists along with today's biggest stars for her first-ever rock album, Rockstar."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dolly-Parton-and-Miley-Cyrus-via-Insider-2.jpg><p>"Inspired by her 2022 induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Dolly teamed up with an all-star roster of musicians for the 30-song collection which includes 9 original tracks and 21 iconic Rock anthems." Cyrus name was featured on track 14, in Parton's highly anticipated rendition of her hit, Wrecking Ball.</p><p>Early this year, Parton said she was proud of the The Last Song star's single, Flowers from her album Endless Summer Vacation. "Yes! I love that song," the 9 to 5 actress said of the post-breakup anthem. "Miley is so great. I mean, I just am so proud of her as a singer and songwriter."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued: "I don't know who wrote that, but I have a feeling she had plenty to do with it. It was her story if not her actual writing, but she's a great songwriter and a great singer, but yeah, I think it's a fantastic song. 'I can hold my own hand, I can buy my own flowers,' you know what a great idea for a song, who needs you? You know?"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Tish Cyrus's Fiancé Dominic Purcell Have A Positive Relationship With Miley and Her Siblings?</a></span></p><h2 id=why-dolly-parton-won-39-t-eat-anything-cooked-by-miley-cyrus>Why Dolly Parton Won't Eat Anything Cooked By Miley Cyrus</h2><p>There is no doubt, Parton will always love Cyrus' music. But anything cooked by her? No. In a recent Zoom interview with Insider to promote her new line of Southern treats with Duncan Hines, she shared some insights into the Malibu singer's cooking style. "I doubt I'd eat much of anything that Miley cooks 'cause it would have no taste," she revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fmt4vg3wiaaecnn.jpeg><p>Parton admitted that "Even if she cooked me something, I'm sure I'd have to doctor it up a little for myself. I would have to have some bacon grease." But she clarified that it's only because "Miley's trying to watch what she eats now — she's gone through a lot of phases of being vegetarian or being vegan or whatever."</p><p>"But in the earlier days," she added, "or when her defenses are down, we still eat that good ol' food like meatloaf." As for her own diet, Parton said her Southern breakfasts always include eggs and whatever she feels like adding at the moment. "I just cook whatever comes to mind and whatever I'm in the mood for," she said. "I can cook any of it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbytuNhmp5qqpKS7brDOnqqnrF2arrV5xaimnWWTpLysscNmmbJlnZ65psWMnLCrraNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-javon-wanna-walton-broken-bone-update-is-he-in-hospital.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Javon Wanna Walton?
