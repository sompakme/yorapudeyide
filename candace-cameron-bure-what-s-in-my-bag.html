This is my everyday bag,” the <a href=#>Aurora Teagarden Mysteries star</a>, 45, <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> of her Christian Dior purse. “I do have, like, a big, big tote when I’m working that I carry and have a lot of other stuff [in] and my computer. But I don’t have that with me today. I just have my purse that, you know, I take when I go grocery shopping and to whatever stores I have to go to.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Candace-Cameron-Bure-Whats-My-Bag-001.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Full House</a> alum is ready for anything in her busy schedule, but safety comes first. Cameron Bure explained that she keeps a face covering in all her bags “because we’re still wearing masks, at least in California” amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>“I try to make them cute and match my outfit,” she said, pointing out a polka dot Lele Sadoughi mask that matches one of her hair accessories.</p><p>Check out <a href=#>the Make It or Break It alum</a>’s complete list of everyday essentials in Us‘ exclusive video above.</p><p><strong>Sunny Side Up</strong></p><p>“I have sunglasses because you need those all the time in California,” the Christmas Town actress told Us. “So these are my Jacque Marie Mage sunglasses.”</p><p><strong>Girly Glam</strong></p><p>“I have a headband because sometimes I need my hair to be out of my face,” Cameron Bure revealed. “So I keep a lot of hair accessories and this is my Lele Sadoughi headband.”</p><p><strong>Bedazzled Beauty</strong></p><p>“I have a hairbrush! It’s like a little Mason Pearson hairbrush that was blinged out for me by <a href=#><strong>Michael Campion</strong></a>‘s mom, <strong>Sheila</strong>,” the Fuller House alum, who portrayed D.J. Tanner-Fuller for five seasons alongside Campion’s character, Jackson Fuller. “His mom wears a lot of bling and she made this hairbrush for me, but I love it. It’s really one of my favorites and it’s always in my purse.”</p><p><strong>California Glow</strong></p><p>“I’ve got a lot of junk in here,” Cameron Bure noted, pulling out multiple beauty items. “What do we go to next? ‘Cause now it’s pretty much all makeup products. There’s a lot.” Cameron Bure then highlighted her “biggest” product, the Dr. Lancer Dani Glowing Skin Perfector.</p><p>“So this I can put on my face in the morning if I don’t have foundation on, it at least smooths my skin tone out,” she said. “Or if I want to use it as a highlighter, I can put it on my cheekbones and my nose. It acts as a primer. It’s like a three in one. And so I keep that with me.”</p><p><strong>Full Purse</strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’ve got a Kind Bar, because I always need a snack,” the Puppy Love star added.</p><p>What else is in Cameron Bure’s bag?
