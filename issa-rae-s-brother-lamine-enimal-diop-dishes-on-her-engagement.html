He’s just a cool guy,” the rapper told Us Weekly exclusively at the Los Angeles premiere of Rae’s movie Little on Monday, April 8. “They’ve been dating forever. He’s already been like a brother to me. Family ties at all the family events and dinners, Christmas, Thanksgiving.”</p><p>Enimal said the couple have not had time for an engagement party, so “we’re just going to celebrate once it’s time for the ceremony.”</p><p>“They did it around the holidays,” he told Us of Diame’s proposal. “She’s so low-key too — for real! I found out, like, a couple days later, so we’re just gonna let her lead the way.”</p><p>Enimal revealed that the bride- and groom-to-be have not set a wedding date just yet, likely because the actress’ burgeoning career is her main focus at the moment.</p><p>“We celebrate all her accolades,” he raved. “They keep rolling in and we’re trying to keep up!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Issa-Raes-Brother-Lamine-Diop-Dishes-on-Her-Low-Key-Engagement-02.jpg><p>The musician has appeared in several episodes of his sister’s HBO comedy, which has only drawn more attention to his own career — including a few thinkpieces on his good looks.</p><p>“My sister is disgusted by it. Like, ‘This is the grossest website article ever,’” Enimal told Us with a laugh. “But I’m absolutely obsessed with ‘em. Keep these great editorials coming. This is quality journalism!”</p><p>Though Rae, 34, herself has not publicly announced her engagement to her longtime love, eagle-eyed fans were quick to point out the enormous diamond ring on her left hand in her recent Essence magazine photo shoot. Soon after it was published, her <a href=#>costars finally spilled the beans</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We’re very excited for her,” <strong>Yvonne Orji</strong> told Entertainment Tonight in March. <strong>Jay Ellis</strong> added, “We all found out in different ways because we’re all on different text chains.”</p><p>With reporting by Taylor Ferber</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaiq6OWerOtxKxkm6qfqbWmvoylmKahnpp6prrIppilZZSevLF5w6KqoZ2jYryveceeqWadnpyuqLHMnqWtZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./courteney-cox-sells-longtime-la-home-to-next-door-neighbor-for-4-5-million.html><span>←</span><span>Courteney Cox Sells Longtime LA Home to Next-Door Neighbor For $4.5 Million</span></a>
