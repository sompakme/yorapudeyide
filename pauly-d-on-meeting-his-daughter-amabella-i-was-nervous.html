The Jersey Shore alum (real name: Paul DelVecchio) recently found out that he he fathered a now 6-month-old daughter with former <a href=# rel=noopener>Las Vegas one-night fling,<strong> Amanda Markert</strong></a>. According to the reality star, holding his little bundle of joy for the first time earlier this month was an "exciting feeling."</p><p>"I was nervous if she wasn't going to like me," the 33-year-old told <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> at the F*ck Cancer NYC Charity Event in NYC Thursday, Nov. 21. "But the second I saw the baby her eyes just lit up, it's almost like she knew," he gushed. "It was amazing. I knew she was mine right off the bat too because she looks just like me. She came right over to me and put her arms right up to me." He laughed: "[She] grabbed my hair! That's the first thing she went for. And then she was biting my nose."</p><p>"I didn't know what to expect, and then you know, it's almost like I knew what to do. I felt comfortable holding her. It was an exciting feeling [and] all the nervousness went away," he added, boasting that his little girl bears a strong resemblance to him. "She has the same big eyes. Same forehead, [and] same mouth." The star's mom, <strong>Donna DiCarlo DelVecchio</strong>, also got the chance to meet the little girl.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>While the first meeting</a> proved to be an exciting one, there's seemingly still a long way to go with the mother of his child. On Oct. 24, former Hooters waitress <a href=# rel=noopener>Markert was spotted visiting</a> Reynolds & Scheffler Law Offices in Atlantic City amid the parents' custody battle.</p><p>"That's what we're working out now," he said of the <a href=# rel=noopener>custody proceedings.</a> "I'm going to see [Amabella] as much as I possibly can, but there's a process because of the way that everything happened. So it's in the lawyer's hands, but I just want to give the baby the best life possible. I want to see her as much as I possibly can."</p><p>And that means on the road, too. "I travel a lot, but when I'm in Vegas I'm going to have a nursery there, when I'm in Rhode Island I'm going to have a nursery there."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But for now, Christmas shopping is a main focus for the DJ. "I got a ton of clothes. I'm big on <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> so I got her a ton of Jordans already to match me. She's going to be a fresh little girl," he exclaimed.</p><p>As for any plans for baby No. 2? "One day, one day. One at a time though I just had this one!" he said. Another thing he won't be pumping the breaks on? One-night stands! "Uh no," he said of stopping. "Protection!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapmaWhxm6wjKilZqWVmsGqusZmn6KrXZmutrPHrZyrZZGirqOxy6WYZqFdrK60ec2eqa%2Bnpah6uLvNrWSgoaaaera8jKilnmWenrSpwIysq5qmlKh6tbTOrp6hZWJlfnR%2BkWpoaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./olivia-rodrigo-reacts-to-rumors-that-vampire-is-about-taylor-swift.html><span>←</span><span>Olivia Rodrigo Reacts to Rumors That 'Vampire' Is About Taylor Swift</span></a>
