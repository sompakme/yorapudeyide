Whisky or whiskey is an alcoholic beverage that was made from some fermented grain mash. Many different grains are used for different varieties like corn, rye, barley, and wheat. Typically, whisky is aged on wooden casks, which are usually sherry casks, or it can be made of charred white oak. <a href=#>Whisky has a lot of types</a> and classes and has a strictly regulated spirit in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It takes years of process to produce a fine whisky. That is why many people are willing to pay a hefty amount so that they can taste a great whisky. However, if you want to taste an excellent whiskey, you need to break a bank because most great-tasting whiskey is expensive. Listed below are some of the most costly whiskies sold in the market.</p><h2 id=dalmore-64-trinitas-160-000>Dalmore 64 Trinitas – $160,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dalmore 64 Trinitas is an excellent blend of the distillery’s rare vintages and most special vintages. It is a good combination of the whiskies from the years 1868, 1878, 1926, and 1939. Because of the rareness of this whisky, there is already a bit of scarcity for this product, and not much of this type of whisky is available on the market. There are only three bottles of Dalmore 64 Trinitas ever made, and currently, just one is available for sale. It is not known if the other <a href=#>two bottles were sold</a> or just consumed by the owners; however, it is more likely that the bottle of Dalmore 64 Trinitas will show up eventually at an auction for a much higher price than the original price.</p><h2 id=dalmore-62-250-000>Dalmore 62 – $250,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dalmore has set a record for the most expensive bottle of whisky ever sold at Changi Airport in 2011. Dalmore 62, which is a single Highland malt Scotch whisky, first came out in 2002. And the last bottle of Dalmore 62 was bought in Singapore. Dalmore 62 is another vintage and super rare whisky from Dalmore. Like the Dalmore 64 Trinitas, the whisky is more than a century old and dates back to the 19th century. The wooden mold that was used to create the decanter for this whisky was<a href=#> handcrafted for 100 hours</a>. There is also a crystal and platinum decanter for the whisky, which costs about $250,000.</p><p>RELATED: <a href=#>The History Behind Luxurious Scotch Whisky</a></p><h2 id=the-macallan-64-in-lalique-cire-perdue-464-000>The Macallan 64 in Lalique Cire Perdue – $464,000</h2><p>The Macallan 64 in Lalique Cire Perdue is a 64-year-old whisky that is sold for $464,000. It is a super rare bottle of whisky because just one bottle was produced by the owners, and all of the proceeds from the sale went straight ahead to a charity. The Macallan 64 in Lalique Cire Perdue is one of the most exquisite and <a href=#>most expensive whiskies worldwide</a>. It was sold at an auction for $460,000. The charity it went to was named water, a nonprofit organization that aims to help people in rural areas to have better access to clean water that is safe for drinking. The bottle of this whisky is highly valued due to its decanters. The drink is a combination of drinks from Spanish oak barrels of 1942, 1945, and 1946.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=macallan-m-628-205>Macallan M $628,205</h2><p>The Macallan M is also one of the super rare whiskies in the world. The high price of the whisky came from its bottle, which is a heavy and faceted crystal decanter that holds about six liters of the purest and most refined of the Macallan M whisky. This whisky was sold at an auction in Hong Kong at $628,205. The whisky itself is vintage since the combination of the whiskies in the bottle is from 25 years to over 75 years.</p><h2 id=isabella-s-islay-6-200-000>Isabella’s Islay – $6,200,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Isabella’s Islay has a high value because of the decanter of the bottle, which has about 8500 diamonds, 300 rubies, and lots of exquisite white gold in it. Even if the bottle only has water in it, the price of the bottle will be estimated to be still at $6 million. However, as for the whisky’s taste, it is absolutely<a href=#> the finest whisky money can buy</a>, not considering the decanter. Therefore, Isabella’s Islay can be viewed as a luxury whisky, and even when you take out the stones and diamonds on the bottle of the whisky, it will still cost a lot of money.</p><p>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Of The Best And Most Expensive Recording Studios In The World</a></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MoneyInc</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bevvy</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TwistedLifestyle</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8yopZ6xXaS7bsDHnmSrp5OgwG6BjKamrKxdmsWxsc2soK%2BdXay1qr%2FKopysZZmjerW0xGauqKqcmXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lucille-ball-the-podcast-host-of-the-1960s.html><span>←</span><span>Lucille Ball: The Podcast Host of the 1960s</span></a>
