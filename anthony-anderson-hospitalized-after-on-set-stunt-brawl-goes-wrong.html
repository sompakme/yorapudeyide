Anderson appeared to be all smiles as he alerted his fans of what went down. He explained that he needed to be patched up after a stunt apparently took a left turn. <a href=#>The comedian said</a>, while nothing serious was wrong with him, he did suffer from a “deep contusion” in his back.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I spent the night in the emergency room,”<a href=#> the entertainer</a> typed. “Movie set fight gone wrong. Me against two goons and a chair! Guess who didn’t win! Who needs a stuntman? Me that’s who! I’m not as young as I used to be! CT scan and X-rays showed nothing fractured or broken in my back just a deep contusion. That chair will never be the same though! Bloodied and bowed but never broken!&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>#RQQ</a>&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>#G20</a>&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>#setlife</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>#moviefights</a>&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>#justakidfromcompton</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>#huskyandhandsome</a>&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>#bidzaddy</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>#acbarbeque</a>“</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In a subsequent post, Anderson joked about the chair that “whooped” on him. He took a picture of a tan and Black chair and detailed how “menacing” it appeared.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“This is the chair that whooped my a** last night,” he continued. “Something about it is menacing! It sucker punched me in the kidneys and back with no mercy! When I got on set today it was grinning at me! Little does he know I got something for that a**! He gone learn today!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Some of the seasoned veteran’s past collaborators <a href=#>and longtime friends</a> chimed in on his injury. They wished him well and reminded him that he needs to be careful. Or that he isn’t “made of rubber,” as <a href=# id=auto-tag_tracee-ellis-ross data-tag=tracee-ellis-ross>Tracee Ellis Ross</a> bluntly put it. “You are not made of rubber. Im so glad you are ok,” she typed to her&nbsp;Black-ish&nbsp;husband.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Yeah man…YOU deliver the quips and let a look-a-like fight the chair. Now you know how it feels to get hit in the back crossing the middle!,” College Football Hall of Famer <a href=# id=auto-tag_desmond-howard data-tag=desmond-howard>Desmond Howard</a> joked.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# id=auto-tag_kym-whitley data-tag=kym-whitley>Kym Whitley</a>, <a href=# id=auto-tag_cedric-the-entertainer data-tag=cedric-the-entertainer>Cedric The Entertainer</a>, Ray Daniels, <a href=# id=auto-tag_tye-tribbett data-tag=tye-tribbett>Tye Tribbett</a>, <a href=# id=auto-tag_loni-love data-tag=loni-love>Loni Love</a>, <a href=# id=auto-tag_anthony-hamilton data-tag=anthony-hamilton>Anthony Hamilton</a>, <a href=# id=auto-tag_kid-capri data-tag=kid-capri>Kid Capri</a>, and more also showed the injured star love (and jokes).&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a7tbTOp7BmmZ6ZsrO%2Fzqdkoaejpba1rcuisZ6cXajBtrrTZpmrmaehenJ%2Bkm1vbW9nZYFw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-will-smith-s-current-relationship-with-alfonso-ribeiro.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Will Smith's Current Relationship With Alfonso Ribeiro?</span></a>
