She didn’t want to “simply burst out on her own,” the author explained, because of certain problems.</p><p>Coast remarked, ” Never felt a love like this before,” after describing that day as “the scariest and most gratifying day of her life by far.” In a nutshell, she’s the finest thing that’s ever happened to me.</p><p>Then she congratulated her boyfriend, adding, “Thank you <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@domfenison</a> for giving me the best gift in the world and being such a fantastic parent already. I adore both of you. The new mother also posted a photo of her sleeping infant with the caption, “Our little nugget sound asleep.” The baby’s name is being kept under wraps for now.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><h2>When the musician was pregnant with Bowie, she spoke publicly about the ups and downs of being pregnant.</h2><p>In an October interview with E!, Chanel said, “It’s not the simplest when you start to grow very, very huge.” “I feel like my face is beginning to swell. I remember asking the photographer, “Hey, can you lift it a little bit so we don’t have the double chin?” On the other hand, I never imagined that being pregnant could be so lovely.</p><h2>Despite the obstacles, the “Trophies” singer maintained a positive body image while her appearance shifted.</h2><p>She said, “It doesn’t matter how you look while you’re pregnant; it’s such a lovely thing, and it all depends on simply how you portray yourself.”</p><p>“Even though I’ve got the bloat and the swelling in my legs and hands, I still do my glam, still do my hair and makeup, put on a gorgeous dress, and just go out there and rock it as if I wasn’t pregnant at all.”</p><p>After being close friends for a while, the “No Plans” singer and the model started dating early this year. The realtor said of the musician, “We’ve known one other for, like, five or so years, but we kind of just revived our friendship ’cause I was in her new music video for ‘Vinyl,'” in a February interview with In Touch.</p><h2>The Baby’s Gender Was Revealed in June.</h2><p>The happy couple announced their impending little girl’s arrival on Instagram back in June. When Fenison opened an umbrella during the gender reveal celebration, a shower of pink confetti rained down, and Coast posted a video of the event online. A video captured the expectant mother’s ecstatic leaps.</p><p>It’s a girl!” 🤗💖🎀🌸🙏🏼🙌🏼 Thanks for loving me the way you do, @domfenison; I love you so much. You’re going to be the greatest Dad ever. 😘😘😘.” Having captioned the photo herself, she had done so.</p><p>Coast announced her pregnancy during the 2022 <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">MTV</a> Movie & TV Awards and the 2022 MTV Movie & TV Awards: Unscripted, both of which took place in the same month. Simply put, I can’t wait to get started on this new chapter of my life. She had previously commented, “This is the toughest journey I’ve ever taken, but sometimes the scariest roads lead to the finest ends.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiho2Kwqa3NnqNmr5WowW6vzpqqrWWgp7KousCnq2hpZmmGeXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-stone-applies-to-be-jeopardy-contestant-every-year.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Stone Applies to Be Jeopardy!
