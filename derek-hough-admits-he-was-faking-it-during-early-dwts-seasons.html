In my earlier seasons, I was nervous, and I was uncertain,” the 36-year-old star said on the Sunday, September 5, episode of the “<a href=#>Whine Down</a>” podcast. “I was kind of faking it, to be honest with you. I wasn’t really a teacher or choreographer.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Derek-Hough-I-Was-Faking-It-During-Early-Dancing-With-Stars-Seasons-001.jpg><p>The Utah native — <a href=#>who competed as a pro 17 times</a>, <a href=#>beginning with season 5 in 2007</a> and ending with season 23 in 2016 — explained that people’s perception of him as a seasoned choreographer when he didn’t feel like one “made me fearful and afraid” of his role on the show.</p><p>“I definitely would get more frustrated easier in my earlier seasons. I look back at some of my earlier seasons, thinking, ‘Man, I wish I knew then what I know now,’” Hough continued. “I probably could have gotten more out of them with a better teaching approach, which I eventually learned and created. I wish I was better earlier on, and I could have given them a better and chance and experience.”</p><p>The <a href=#>six-time mirrorball champion</a> became a judge on the long-running dance series for season 29 in 2020, stepping in for <a href=#><strong>Len Goodman</strong></a> amid travel restrictions between the U.K. and the U.S. during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>“It’s definitely a lot easier, that’s for sure. Dancing of course is harder. Being on the show for 17 seasons I did [all] that [hard work]. There’s all different experiences, triumphs and failures and all the things I could have possibly thought of,” the Hairspray Live! star told podcast host <a href=#><strong>Jana Kramer</strong></a>. “I will say it’s a lot harder — when I was judging on <a href=#>World of Dance</a> it was pretaped [which is easier]. Dancing With the Stars is live, once your time is up that’s it. Being a coach and being a teacher, I really want to give an actual note.”</p><p>While Hough is <a href=#>happy to return as a judge for season 30</a> when it premieres later this month, he previously told Us Weekly that being a pro again isn’t completely off the table.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“When <a href=#><strong>Tom Brady</strong></a> won a seventh Super Bowl, I was like, ‘Oh no, do I need to go for seven here?” the TV personality, who is dating DWTS troupe dancer <a href=#><strong>Hayley Erbert</strong></a>, exclusively joked to Us in May. “No, I think — who knows? I never say never, but for right now, <a href=#>I’m looking forward to going back as a judge</a>.”</p><p>Dancing With the Stars season 30 premieres on ABC Monday, September 20, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJueqpWgeqm71KCfZpmUora1v4yhnGavkah6p63KoqWgZZmpeqXB0aKloGWVlr%2BtxYydrq2rXaiyor%2FOp6po</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./craig-stadler-age-wikipedia-biography-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Craig Stadler Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents.</span></a>
