From lavish birthday trips to a mansion that dreams are made of, we imagine the list of those wishing for the honor to be called her friend is quite long.</p><p>One person who we know can call herself North's friend is Jessica Simpson's daughter Maxwell Johnson. This girl group seems to have the best time when together, and boy, do they know how to throw a party that will make anyone jealous for not getting the invite.</p><h2 id=are-maxwell-johnson-and-north-west-friends><img alt=instar51760690 height=3154 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar51760690.jpg width=2100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Are Maxwell Johnson And North West Friends?</h2><p>Maxwell Johnson is the oldest of Jessica Simpson and Eric Johnson's children. The couple has three children: Maxwell, age ten; Ace, age nine; and Birdie, age three.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Facts About Kim Kardashian And Kanye West's Eldest, North West</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maxwell recently celebrated her tenth birthday, and she did it in style. Her birthday bash was outdoors, with North in attendance, and Penelope Disick, the daughter of Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick. The girls seemed to be all smiles and surrounded by plush toys.</p><p>According to Simpson, the two girls met while playing on the same basketball team, coached by Eric Johnson, and immediately hit it off. While <a href=#>speaking to US Weekly, Simpson said</a> , "One of Maxwell's best friends is North."</p><p>She continued, "And so, watching North, she is amazing, she is a great kid, and she will be a part of the change in this world. Her and Maxwell alone."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the two seemingly thick as thieves, it only makes sense that when it was North's birthday, the invite was sent to Maxwell. Only Miss West isn't playing around when it comes to celebrating.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Of North West's Coolest Outfits (So Far)</a></span></p><h2 id=north-west-knows-how-to-throw-a-party>North West Knows How To Throw A Party</h2><p>Fans were able to catch a glimpse into what it's like to attend a celebrity kid's party when <a href=#>Kim Kardashian took to social media</a> and posted a slew of photos showing off North's birthday bash.</p><p>The official party was titled "Camp North" and kicked off with six of North's friends meeting at a hangar and jumping onto a private plane. The plane was decked out in nature decor with pillows shaped like logs and translucent-like material to reflect clouds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once the girls arrived at their destination, it was nonstop outdoor fun, including a ride on a river raft, a hike across a footbridge, and zip lining above the trees. They also all received matching print pajamas.</p><p>And when the day was over, they each got individual indoor tents decorated with faux fluffy deer heads and fake blood splatter. A private wilderness experience for a ninth birthday? North knows how to do luxury.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Has North West Never Shared Playdates With Blue Ivy?</a></span></p><p>Those lucky enough to get an invitation included North's cousin Penelope; Maxwell, Jessica Simpson's daughter; Chief Marketing Office at KKW (Kim's brand) Tracy Romulus' daughter Ryan; and Kardashian cousin Natalie Zettel's daughter.</p><p>When Kim posted the photos on Instagram, Jessica Simpson commented, "Camp North Magic" with a sparkle emoji.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Simpson also posted her own carousel</a> of the weekend that showed the girls getting private archery lessons. She captioned her post, "CAMP NORTH was magic! Thank you @kimkardashian for giving Maxwell the time of her life and takin' care of my little lady on her first "camp sleep away" trip! I'm comin' next time! 💚"</p><p>While North and Maxwell are living their best life with fun parties and weekend trips away, we will be sitting patiently for the next North TikTok or post by their parents to get a glimpse into what it's like to be the kid of a major celebrity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmpp%2Bnwal51p6qrWWRo7FuucCxrp6knGK3sLTNrKanZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./not-every-frasier-cast-member-was-worth-a-fortune-when-they-died.html><span>←</span><span>Not Every Frasier Cast Member Was Worth A Fortune When They Died</span></a>
