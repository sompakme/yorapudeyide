Even though he was the child of two actors, their elder child, who goes by True, enjoyed a childhood away from media attention. Alley, however, did reveal a few details about her kids' interests in their youth, noting that they were enthusiastic about being in the water, whether it was a pool, ocean, or lake. &nbsp;The actor also observed that her children were interested in animals and environmental stewardship.&nbsp; Alley was passionate about animals, and she had a lot of pets, including 14 lemurs.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2010, True and his younger sister appeared with their mom in all 12 episodes of Alley's reality TV show, "Kirstie Alley's Big Life." That same year, when he was 17, True and his girlfriend, Lauren Sergeant, got engaged. "True's got a level head," Alley said on&nbsp;"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,"&nbsp;supporting her son's decision to get married. However, for unknown reasons, the couple later decided to split up.&nbsp;</p><p>During the summer of 2016, Alley became a first-time grandmother when True's partner, Sarah Parker, gave birth to their son, Waylon Tripp Parker. The actor enjoyed an added bonus of being able to spend three months with her infant grandson when True and Parker worked for Alley, an experience she described to <a href=#>People</a> as "stupendous and exhilarating." The actor also was delighted to observe True's parenting prowess, noting that her son had demonstrated a strong rapport with young children over the years.&nbsp;"He's just an excellent dad, really hands-on," she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57kG1scmljanyuscStZKShoqjBqrGMmqOlnalif263yJ2qZq%2BZobmqrcxmq6utlWK5qrjLopxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./list-of-words-containing-fore.html><span>←</span><span>List of Words Containing 'fore'</span></a>
