She transferred the funds to an account owned by her and her sister. The reality star is asking that the money be returned to a joint account so the exes can divide the money during their divorce.</p><p>TMZ notes that while the judge denied Pedro’s request for an emergency hearing, a date will be set in the future to discuss the financial dispute.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chantel has not publicly responded to her estranged husband’s accusations. However, shortly after Pedro’s filing, Chantel submitted her own paperwork to the court. They have both been granted mutual restraining orders.</p><p>Pedro and Chantel have been married for five years. The pair originally met when Chantel was visiting the Dominican Republic from the U.S. They later applied for a K-1 visa and their road to marriage was documented on 90 Day Fiancé.</p><p>They later scored their own TLC reality show, The Family Chantel, which explores their married life and dynamic with Chantel’s animated family. So far, the show has had four seasons, with the latest one debuting last month. It’s unclear if the show will continue despite the pair’s divorce.</p><p>Last October, the pair discussed their plans for starting a family to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, emphasizing they were in no rush to bring kids into the mix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“ <a href=#>Chantel needs to finish school</a> . Maybe she wants to get a master’s degree,” Pedro said. “I don’t want to do the same mistakes that my father did to me. That’s my main thing. I want my child to have all they need, like a school, food, clothes, toys. It’s very important to me. I want to be the best father in the world.”</p><p>The Family Chantel’s latest season is ongoing on TLC, and fans can expect it to dive deep into the pair’s relationship problems leading up to their divorce.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp; <a href=#>Matt Roloff On Prenup Controversy: My Girlfriend Makes "3x My Worth"</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSGcXnDmrBmnpmWu6SxjKyrmqqjYr2msNGoZJygkaPBpriMnaCvp6KYtq%2BzjJqdrZ2iYsCpsYysq6iklWJ%2FdnyPaWdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-steven-seagal-s-net-worth-and-why-is-it-so-low.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Steven Seagal's Net Worth, And Why Is It So Low?</span></a>
