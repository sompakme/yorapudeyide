The 18-year-old superstar has seen her fame absolutely skyrocket since the breakout release of her debut single "drivers license" last January. And while the multi-talented performer and star of Disney+ original program High School Musical: The Musical: The Series had been in the public eye for several years already, the deeply personal storytelling aspect of her lyrics, brought a renewed interest in the singer's personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Olivia Rodrigo Taking On Tour With Her?</a></span></p><p>The "good 4 u" singer has experienced countless columns written about her relationship with her HSM:TM:TS co-star, Joshua Bassett, after the lyrics on <a href=#>Rodrigo's debut album SOUR revealed secrets about the singer</a>. Just who exactly was she singing about? Joshua Bassett? Or someone else? And is that "blonde girl" she mentions really Sabrina Carpenter?</p><p>But before hooking up with Bassett after meeting on the set of HSM:TM:TS, Olivia Rodrigo enjoyed a relationship with another co-star. Before becoming a household name with seven Grammy Award nominations under her belt, Rodrigo played internet vlogger Paige on the Disney Channel show Bizaardvark from 2016 to 2019. It was here she met Ethan Wacker, who played Bernie Schotz, friend and agent to Paige and her friend Frankie. The pair dated from 2018 to 2019 but seemed to call things off before Rodrigo made it big time with the release of HSM:TM:TS later that year. But are the two actors still friends? And what has Rodrigo said about staying in touch with an ex after a breakup?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olivia-rodrigo-and-adam-faze-have-reportedly-broken-up>Olivia Rodrigo And Adam Faze Have Reportedly Broken Up</h2><p>During the rollout of her album SOUR, Rodrigo would <a href=#>hook up with 24-year-old producer Adam Faze</a> midway through 2021, first being spotted together at the premiere of Space Jam: A New Legacy in June. The budding relationship took the spotlight off the drama surrounding Rodrigo and Bassett, and the pair were spotted kissing just one month later. Page Six reports that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship did not last into the new year</a>, however, with the couple not spending New Year's Eve together, and not being seen together since last November.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rumors swirled when Rodrigo unfollowed both Faze's professional and personal Instagram accounts, but the singer has since unfollowed everybody, setting her follower count to zero, while Faze continues to follow the "brutal" singer. She seemed to allude to a breakup in her interview with British Vogue, however, while discussing <a href=#>the best way to get over someone</a>. "Besides cutting off all contact, I think it’s important to not only forgive them but forgive yourself for letting everything happen,” she told the publication. "That’s what I’ve learned."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Olivia Rodrigo And Conan Gray Planning A Collaboration?</a></span></p><h2 id=olivia-rodrigo-could-not-cut-off-all-contact-with-joshua-bassett>Olivia Rodrigo Could Not Cut Off All Contact With Joshua Bassett</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cutting off all contact might be Olivia Rodrigo's ideal way to deal with a breakup, but unfortunately, despite trying, the "deja vu" singer couldn't do that with her previous alleged partner Joshua Bassett. While Rodrigo and Bassett <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">never publicly confirmed that they were an item</a>, or that he left her for Carpenter, it is widely accepted that the pair were together, with the lyrics to SOUR largely documenting their relationship, and <a href=#>Bassett and Carpenter both releasing music of their own that hints at the love triangle</a>. And being the co-stars of hit Disney+ show High School Musical: The Musical: The Series that Rodrigo and Bassett were, they had no choice but to continue to work together, being <a href=#>under contract for at least the upcoming third season</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it does seem that things are icy between the two co-stars. Bassett has publicly praised Rodrigo's music over the last year, but in a December interview with GQ, he announced that, despite trying to reach out, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rodrigo hasn't spoken to him since "drivers license" was released last January</a>. Weeks later <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he would unfollow Rodrigo on Instagram</a>, ahead of their upcoming reunion on the set of season three. He continues to follow other HSM:TM:TS co-stars such as Matt Cornett and Sofia Wylie.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Joshua Bassett’s New Songs About Olivia Rodrigo?</a></span></p><h2 id=are-olivia-rodrigo-and-ethan-wacker-still-friends>Are Olivia Rodrigo And Ethan Wacker Still Friends?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This brings us to Olivia's first relationship in the spotlight - her relationship with Bizaardvark co-star Ethan Wacker. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The relationship was confirmed</a> in January 2019 when Wacker posted an anniversary celebration to his Instagram account. "Happy 6 months! You are the greatest," the actor, now 19, wrote alongside a picture of the pair. And while the loved-up couple would post pictures of one another over the next eight months, even going on a romantic holiday escape to Hawaii together, eagle-eyed fans noticed the two co-stars deleted all pictures of one another from social media in August of that year. By this point, Bizaardvark's production had ended, Rodrigo was filming HSM:TM:TS, and was reportedly involved with Bassett.</p><p>It looks like, unlike with Bassett and Faze, things never turned sour between the former co-stars and lovers. In May 2020, Wacker posted on Instagram that he had been accepted into Vanderbilt University. Rodrigo shared the news to her followers on her Instagram story, writing "Ahhhh I’m so proud! He’s the best!" And until her great Instagram unfollow of January 2022, Rodrigo and Wacker still followed each other and supported each other's achievements. Wacker added fuel to the Rodrigo / Bassett drama just weeks after "driver's license" was released when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he shut down a theory on Tiktok that the song was about him</a>. "Nope," he wrote in the comments section of the video. "I treated her well."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Out of the three major relationships Olivia Rodrigo has had since being in the spotlight, it looks like only she and Ethan Wacker have no bad blood between them, and are still friends to this day!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Olivia Rodrigo’s Ex Joshua Bassett Opens Up His Past Regarding Abuse</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimpaGmnq5uvs6dqaKfn2KytbTAp2SwmZOgsrN5xLFkn6qZmrulv4yboLOZkaext63RpGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./igor-bogdanoff-enfant-dimitri-bogdanoff-wife-genevi%C3%A8ve-grad-and-family.html><span>←</span><span>Igor Bogdanoff Enfant Dimitri Bogdanoff Wife Genevive Grad and Family</span></a>
