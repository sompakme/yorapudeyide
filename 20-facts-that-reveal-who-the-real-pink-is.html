She's known for some big hits, such as, "Beautiful Trauma", "Who Knew" and "So What". To say that this woman has had an extraordinary life is really an understatement, given what she’s been through.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>Coming from an abusive household and finding herself close to an overdose at the age of 15, it once seemed as if all odds were against Pink, who started writing songs at the young age of 14. How did she turn things around so dramatically, and then hang onto her success through the decades?</p><p class=p1>Well, Alecia is a woman of many talents, having often implemented acrobatics into her live performances - simply put, Pink is a pop icon. She’s surpassed 20 years in the industry, but is there anything else fans need to know about her? There sure is!</p><p class=p1>Here are 20 facts that reveal who the real Pink is.</p><h2 id=her-real-name-isn-t-pink><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Her Real Name Isn’t Pink</span></h2><p class=p1>Pink isn’t actually the singer’s real name - her birth name is Alecia Beth Moore, born on September 8, 1979. The decision to make the switch came about when a number of her friends started referring to her as Pink. This seems ironic since Alecia is an edgy rock star who is far from soft and innocent (as her stage name might suggest she is).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-a-former-mcdonald-s-employee><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>She’s A Former McDonald’s Employee</span></h2><p class=p1>Before making it in Hollywood, Pink was working a number of not-so-fun, not-so-high-paying jobs. She put in honest hard work at Pizza Hut, McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and even a gas station. It was clear that she was determined to make enough money to continue striving for a career in music.</p><h2 id=she-used-to-be-in-a-group-called-choice><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>She Used To Be In A Group Called Choice</span></h2><p class=p1>Prior to being offered a solo record deal, Pink was in a girl group called Choice. The trio was formed to take on the likes of TLC, Destiny’s Child, and Spice Girls but things fell apart rather quickly. It wasn’t long before everybody decided to go their separate ways. Pink was the only one who ended up with a solo record deal.</p><h2 id=she-considers-carey-hart-the-love-of-her-life><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>She Considers Carey Hart The Love Of Her Life</span></h2><p class=p1>Carey Hart has a sometimes-rocky&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship</a> with her husband, Carey Hart. They've had ups and downs through the years. However, they've gotten out on the other side, stronger than ever before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>Having once planned to go it alone, Pink has never shied away from admitting that her man is truly the love of her life. She shares two children with him - Willow and Jameson.</p><h2 id=she-incorporates-acrobatics-into-her-concerts><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>She Incorporates Acrobatics Into Her Concerts</span></h2><p class=p1>Those who are familiar with Pink’s live performances already know that she’s extremely skilled when it comes to acrobatics and gymnastics. No wonder this mother-of-two often implements these elements into her shows. At the 2017 American Music Awards, for example, she scaled a building while performing her song, "Beautiful Trauma".</p><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Swoon-Worthy Facts About Pink’s Marriage To Carey Hart</a></span></p><h2 id=before-taking-over-pop-she-was-an-r-amp-b-singer><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Before Taking Over Pop, She Was An R&B Singer</span></h2><p class=p1>Pink was initially marketed as an R&B singer, with her then-boss (record producer LA Reid) telling her how to brand her image...he also told her what type of sound she needed to go for when recording music in the studio.</p><p class=p1>Her debut album, "Can’t Take Me Home", was a hit, but it seemed that the pop route was where label execs felt Pink could have an even bigger impact.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-has-a-huge-crush-on-johnny-depp><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>She Has A Huge Crush On Johnny Depp</span></h2><p class=p1>Pink has openly admitted in the past that one of her biggest crushes is on Hollywood superstar, Johnny Depp. The A-list actor&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">once surprised her</a> at an interview taping with Jimmy Kimmel - and it went without saying that Pink looked embarrassed as she gave her crush a hug. The audience cheered her on. She’s also said to have taken a liking to Michael Keaton.</p><h2 id=she-built-an-unlikely-friendship-with-channing-tatum><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>She Built An Unlikely Friendship With Channing Tatum</span></h2><p class=p1>Pink and Channing Tatum bonded when they met on the set of the singer’s music video for "Beautiful Trauma". The duo played a doting couple going through problems in their relationship, but it’s the dance number that really captivated everyone’s attention. They both said that working together was a lot of fun...and a friendship came out of it, too.</p><h2 id=she-s-a-huge-fan-of-rapper-eminem><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>She’s A Huge Fan Of Rapper Eminem</span></h2><p class=p1>Pink has got to be one of Eminem’s biggest fans, which her own fans find adorable. The fact is that the "Family Portrait" hitmaker is such a big star in her own right, but still likes working with other artists...especially rappers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>For her album "Beautiful Trauma", Pink was said to have emailed Eminem, asking if he would be interested in collaborating (again) and he couldn’t say no. They’ve previously worked on two songs - "Need Me" and "Won’t Back Down".</p><h2 id=she-won-a-grammy-for-lady-marmalade><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>She Won A Grammy For 'Lady Marmalade'</span></h2><p class=p1>Having won three Grammys to date, Pink’s most memorable win was for 2001’s "Lady Marmalade", which won Best Pop Collaboration at the awards ceremony in 2002. The song featured Christina Aguilera, Missy Elliott, Mýa, and rapper Lil Kim. The track went on to spend five weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Pics Of Reese Witherspoon’s Transformation From 1990 To 2020</a></span></p><h2 id=she-hates-many-of-her-tattoos><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Hates Many Of Her Tattoos</span></h2><p class=p1>She got most of her tattoos when she was in her early 20s, and she has evolved since then. Pink has often stressed that she regrets getting inked up on some parts of her body. She’s previously mentioned that having tattoos on the front of her body has somewhat bothered her, the older she’s gotten.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>“If I had an eraser, woosh…If I could start over, I’d do just one big back piece and have a clean [front]. I’m into balance,” the pop star said.</p><h2 id=aside-from-singing-she-s-also-a-part-time-actress><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Aside From Singing, She’s Also A Part-Time Actress</span></h2><p class=p1>Pink is a triple threat who doesn’t just sing; she’s also a dancer and an actress. Over the years, the blonde beauty has appeared in a number of feature films, including Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle, Get Him to the Greek, Happy Feet Two, Rollerball, and Thanks for Sharing. Her main passion is still music and touring.</p><h2 id=she-started-writing-songs-in-her-teenage-years><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>She Started Writing Songs In Her Teenage Years</span></h2><p class=p1>Pink always had an ear for music; once she turned 14, all that she would find herself doing was writing songs. She planned to record them in a studio one day. And given her tough upbringing, there were plenty of things that Pink could write about - particularly matters concerning the relationship between her family members.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-earlier-songs-were-inspired-by-her-rough-childhood><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Her Earlier Songs Were Inspired By Her Rough Childhood</span></h2><p class=p1>Pink was just three years old when her parents decided to call it quits and get a divorce, which she openly discusses in songs such as 2002’s, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Family Portrait</a>". This song, in particular, became a smash hit for Pink, peaking in the top 20 in Sweden, Germany, New Zealand, the U.K. and the U.S.</p><p class=p1>Her fans clearly related to what she had been through in her own life, and it showed through the success of her music.</p><h2 id=she-s-one-of-the-best-selling-artists-in-the-world><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She’s One Of The Best-Selling Artists In The World</span></h2><p class=p1>Since launching her solo career, Pink has sold an impressive 40 million albums and 50 million singles internationally, making her one of the best-selling artists in the world. She’s without a doubt one of the most influential pop stars, who has continued to dominate the industry with chart-topping singles and sold-out concerts across the globe.</p><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Times The Kardashians Were The Biggest Sweethearts (10 Times They Acted Like Jerks)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-once-called-it-quits-with-carey-hart><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Once Called It Quits With Carey Hart</span></h2><p class=p1>In 2008, Pink and Carey Hart decided to call it quits and announced they had agreed to get a divorce. Things clearly weren’t working for the two at the time and both of them felt they needed a break from one another. Interestingly enough, however, the duo later went on to retract their statement. They decided to give their romance another try - and they’ve been together ever since.</p><h2 id=she-owned-a-bulldog-gifted-from-priscilla-presley><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Owned A Bulldog Gifted From Priscilla Presley</span></h2><p class=p1>In what seems to be quite the random fact, Pink once had a bulldog named Elvis. But it’s the person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who gifted her the animal</a> that makes this so bizarre - it was Elvis Presley’s former wife, Priscilla. Apparently, the two had formed a close bond over the years, but gifting someone a dog seems a little over the top. Perhaps not when you’re giving to a rock star like Pink, though.</p><h2 id=pink-once-feuded-with-christina-aguilera><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Pink Once Feuded With Christina Aguilera</span></h2><p class=p1>At the beginning of her pop career, Pink found herself feuding with Christina Aguilera. The two worked together on the song, "Lady Marmalade", but it was revealed that they didn’t get along.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>Pink was said to have been annoyed by Christina’s demands; Aguilera wanted to sing more parts of the song than the others! While the other women refused to argue with Christina, Pink put up quite the fight. The pop divas have since squashed their issues, however.</p><h2 id=her-stage-name-originates-from-reservoir-dogs><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Her Stage Name Originates From ‘Reservoir Dogs’</span></h2><p class=p1>Quentin Tarantino’s film,&nbsp;Reservoir Dogs, is what apparently inspired Pink to stick with the name. In the blockbuster flick, the character, Mr. Pink, apparently shares a lot of character traits with the singer - at least that’s what those closest to Pink thought at the time. The name stuck, so when it was time to create her stage name, there wasn’t much to think about.</p><h2 id=she-dropped-out-of-high-school><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>She Dropped Out Of High School</span></h2><p>Pink wasn’t into education one bit. She dropped out of high school and ended up spiraling out of control when she was just 15 years old. From petty crimes to experimenting with different substances that almost led to an overdose, Pink lived a chaotic lifestyle before she had even turned 18. In 1998, however, she went back to finish school and earned her G.E.D.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1><span class="related-single next-single">NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">13 Celebs Who Are Part Of Lady Gaga’s Inner Circle (7 Who Stay Away)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhpaWWWlrC1v4ytn5qsXaeyt7HApWSwoJ9iwamxjKucmqRdpbavt4yiqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-dolly-parton-refuses-to-eat-anything-cooked-by-miley-cyrus.html><span>←</span><span>Why Dolly Parton Refuses To Eat Anything Cooked By Miley Cyrus</span></a>
