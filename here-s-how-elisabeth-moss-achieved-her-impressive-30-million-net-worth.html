Indeed, life is good for the actress. Her net worth is also a testament to how far she’s come.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elisabeth-moss-had-several-breakout-roles-throughout-her-career>Elisabeth Moss Had Several Breakout Roles Throughout Her Career</h2><p>Moss started early in Hollywood, having only been 17 years old when she was cast to play the first daughter, Zoey Bartlet, in the Emmy-winning series The West Wing. And soon after the show ended its run in 2006, Moss went on to star as Don Draper’s (Jon Hamm) secretary, Peggy Olson, in the hit AMC drama Mad Men.</p><p>Working on the show may have kept Moss busy on most days. Nonetheless, she also made her Broadway debut, acting alongside William H. Macy and Raúl Esparza in the three-hander Mamet, which Moss described as “an emotional, physical and mental marathon. Eight shows a week is very difficult.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was the first theater work she had ever done since moving to New York at age 19 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the whole experience has been exhilarating yet exhausting</a>. “I did Mad Men for four months until the end of August, then started rehearsals here in early September,” Moss explained. “But I get to work with the most amazing actors - and do Mamet, which is unusual for a woman. There aren't that many female parts, so I feel lucky that I got one.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, once Mad Men ended (and <a href=#>any plan involving a Peggy spinoff didn’t materialize</a>), Moss agreed to work on The Handmaid’s Tale almost soon after, which the actress didn’t expect to do herself. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the material was just too good to pass up</a>. “I didn’t think I’d sign on to another show so quickly, but I was like, ‘I’m not going to be able to say no to this. I’m going to have to do it,’” the actress explained. “The thing that finally pushed it over the edge was the idea of anyone else doing the role, and how jealous I would be if anyone else got to do it.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Things Most Fans Didn't Know About The Making Of The Handmaid's Tale</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show also reunited Moss with fellow Emmy winner Bradley Whitford whom she first worked with on The West Wing. Of the actress’ performance in the Hulu series, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor couldn’t be prouder</a>. “I remember the day I met her, in a kitchen set. I think she was 17, and she was so great,” Whitford remarked. “But to come back and see this person as not only a grown woman but giving the performance of a generation…”</p><h2 id=what-is-elisabeth-moss-rsquo-s-net-worth-in-2022>What Is Elisabeth Moss’s Net Worth In 2022?</h2><p>Recent estimates indicate that the actress is now worth as much as $30 million. While the actress was reportedly paid a modest salary of $75,000 on Mad Men, Hulu happily paid Moss an astonishing $1 million per episode for The Handmaid’s Tale. And since the actress was also named one of the executive producers beginning season two, likely, Moss has also likely been collecting more than just her talent fee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, on the movie front, Moss’ gamble also paid off when she negotiated a profit share for The Invisible Man, which ended up being an unexpected hit. The movie went on to earn $134.3 million at the box office, against a reported production cost of $7 million. Hence, in 2020 alone, it is believed that Moss earned a cool $16 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>An Inside Look: Elisabeth Moss Pranks Her Best Friend During Movie Premiere</a></span></p><p>That same year, it is also worth noting that Moss launched her own production company, Love & Squalor Pictures, and subsequently landed a first-look tv deal with Disney-owned Hulu and Fox 21 Television Studios. As a result, the company is now developing the thriller Black Match, in which Moss is also attached as a star. <a href=#>The actress would have also starred in and executive produced Hulu’s crime drama Candy</a>, but Moss eventually had to bow out due to scheduling conflicts. Meanwhile, her company is also behind Apple TV+’s crime thriller Shining Girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, Moss is also attached to at least three upcoming films. One of which is the sports comedy Next Goals Wins from Oscar-winning director Taika Waititi. The film is an adaptation of a 2014 British documentary that tells the story of the American Samoa soccer team losing to Australia with a final score of 31-0. It is believed to be the worst World Cup loss on record.</p><p>The actress is also reportedly set to portray Francis Ford Coppola’s wife, Eleanor Coppola, in the upcoming drama Francis and the Godfather. The film delves into the behind-the-scenes drama between the famous filmmaker and producer Robert Evans while filming The Godfather. Oscar Isaac will reportedly play Coppola himself (Moss’ husband) while Jake Gyllenhaal has been tapped to play Evans.</p><p>Meanwhile, The Handmaid’s Tale will also return for a fifth season. As of writing, there is no word on the show’s release date yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Reason Fans Think Elisabeth Moss And Tom Cruise Used To Be A Couple</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpaGjlq%2BmwMdmpKiro2K7psCMsKarrJhif3F%2BkWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./grimes-and-kanye-west-are-helping-elon-musk-with-his-most-ridiculous-project-yet.html><span>←</span><span>Grimes And Kanye West Are Helping Elon Musk With His Most Ridiculous Project Yet</span></a>
