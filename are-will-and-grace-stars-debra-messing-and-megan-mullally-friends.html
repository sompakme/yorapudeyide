Fans immediately assumed she was referencing her friendship with Debra, leading Mullally to take down the post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although all signs were pointing to the duo being in a feud, 'Will & Grace', lead star, Eric McCormack, who played Will, claimed that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> there is nothing to be worried about. </a>McCormack made it clear that "the four of us get along like a house on fire, we always have", he said.
