(Brady spent much of his NFL career as a quarterback for the team.)</p><p class=p1>“‘I’m the best decision your organization has ever made,’” Ross said, impersonating Brady. “‘Would you like a massage?’” (Kraft, 82, was charged in 2019 for soliciting prostitution at a Florida massage parlor. He was ultimately cleared of all charges.)</p><p class=p1>Brady, however,<a href=#> appeared to be bothered</a> by the subtle dig and walked up to the podium to stage-whisper in Ross’ ear.</p><p class=p1>“Don’t say that s—t again,” Brady told Ross, who then replied, “OK, OK. [Robert is] having fun, look at him.”</p><p class=p1>As the roast aired, many viewers theorized that there was real beef between Brady and Ross.</p><p class=p1>“They want there to be something so bad,” McHale quipped on Thursday. “They want to point out, ‘That person said that thing.’ But [Tom] even killed it. He was very smooth.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Joel-McHale-Says-Tom-Brady-s-Jeff-Ross-Warning-at-Roast-Was-A-Bit-inline.jpg><p class=p1>Ross, for his part, had reportedly been concerned about how Brady would take his jokes.</p><p class=p1>“Afterward, he was a little like … he was a little bit worried,” <strong>Nikki Glaser</strong>, who also performed on the roast, later <a href=#>recalled on <i>The Howard Stern Show</i></a>. “We have consciences about these things. You know, afterward, we go, ‘Did that really hurt his feelings?’ And I go, ‘You know, [Tom] had to do it performatively for Robert, I’m sure.’ But I’m sure it was not an issue that Jeff was going to hear about today or anything like that.”</p><p class=p1><strong>Kevin Hart</strong> emceed the roast on Sunday, enlisting everyone from Ross, Glaser and more to joke about Brady’s NFL career and retirement, as well <a href=#>as his 2022 divorce</a> from <strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I didn’t know how big of a deal it was. I didn’t realize we’d be sitting at tables,” McHale recalled. “I brought my 16-year-old [son], so I was like, ‘You enjoying these dirty jokes, son?’ They showed him [on camera] once because his friends [saw him]. He’s a huge football fan, so he knew all the [athletes there]. It was f—king good and I really enjoyed it, and the joke-telling was pretty great.”</p><p class=p1>He continued, “They’re pros, so they should be crushing it, but then the football players got up there. Drew Bledsoe, he nailed it. Overall, it’s a hard thing to do and it was live. [It was] so seamless.”</p><p class=p3><span class=s1><i>The Roast of Tom Brady </i>is now streaming on Netflix.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGonZxiuqS0wKWcZquRrsBuwM6mZJuqkZnGtHnJnp2fZaKkwLR51pqpp6GenHqiwIyrppqrpGLEor%2BMmmSboaRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-momoa-congratulates-stepdaughter-zoe-kravitz-on-catwoman-role.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Momoa Congratulates Stepdaughter Zoe Kravitz on Catwoman Role</span></a>
