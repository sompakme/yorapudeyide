Yes - in fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">these two actors are even closer in real life than their characters</a> on The Big Bang Theory. This is only natural since they have had to work so closely over the last few years. We believe that these two developed a very strong bond soon after they started working together. Jim and Kaley's relationship is an unbreakable one, and one fans enjoy following. They may seem like chalk and cheese but they are more similar than we'd think.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:00</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ttweb_kaley-cuoco-s-forgotten-young-sheldon-cameo-had-her-teasing-sheldon-long-before-the-big-bang-theory_bk_a1_v3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Kaley Cuoco's Forgotten Young Sheldon Cameo Had Her Teasing Sheldon Long Before The Big Bang Theory">Kaley Cuoco's Forgotten Young Sheldon Cameo Had Her Teasing Sheldon Long Before The Big Bang Theory</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Kaley Cuoco returned to torment Sheldon in Young Sheldon, but many fans don't remember this moment.</p><h2 id=jim-parsons-and-kaley-cuoco-admit-that-they-love-each-other-as-friends-obviously><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Jim Parsons And Kaley Cuoco Admit That They Love Each Other (As Friends Obviously)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/your-paragraph-text-43.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's nothing like a little love flying around to make one smile.
