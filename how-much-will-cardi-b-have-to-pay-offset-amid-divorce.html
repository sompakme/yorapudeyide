After coming to prominence back in 2017, with her hit rap song, "Bodak Yellow", Cardi B has become unstoppable. While she's been around for quite some time, her rap career has certainly served her well. Cardi and Offset had a spur of the moment wedding in 2017 and took their first break from one another back in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After 2 years, the duo appeared to be stronger than ever, especially after having welcomed their baby girl, Kulture. Although the two seemed to have been head over heels in love, things took a turn and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardi has officially filed for divorce</a>. Fans have been sending in their support to the rap artist, however, one thing they've also picked up on is that the two don't seem to have signed a prenup!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Cardi B Threatens To Expose All On 'OnlyFans' Amid Divorce From Rapper Offset</a></span></p><h2 id=cardi-b-amp-offset-no-more>Cardi B & Offset No More!</h2><p>Cardi B and Migos' very own, Offset, have been going strong since the duo got married in secret. While they definitely experienced their fair share of ups and downs throughout their relationship, including a temporary split back in 2018, it appears as if the couple is no longer. The "Bodak Yellow" rapper announced last week that she had filed for divorce from Offset after 3 years of marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple also does not appear to have a prenup, meaning Cardi would then be forced to pay over 50% of assets and earnings made during their time together. Considering Cardi has<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> grown her fortune to $24 million</a> since her debut in 2015, that would mean Offset could walk away with anywhere between $10 - $12 million if a judge declares so.</p><p>This is definitely a difficult time for both Cardi and Offset, however, it isn't the first time Cardi has wanted a divorce.&nbsp;During their split in 2018, rumors surrounding divorce had come up, however, the couple managed to work through things and focus on taking care of their daughter, Kulture Cephus. Although history may be repeating itself, it seems as if Cardi B is certain this time around, and is ready to officially split from hubby, Offset. Many fans believed that the couple is divorcing due to cheating, however, that doesn't seem to be the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Cardi B’s ‘WAP’ Video Depicts Some Very Interesting Art On The Walls</a></span></p><p>Cardi B made it clear that she is choosing to leave Offset due to their marriage being "irretrievably broken." She also revealed that she was done arguing with Offset for good, and wanted out. In addition to the two no longer getting along, Cardi also made it clear that she is by no means sad about how things have turned out. The "WAP" rapper revealed that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> she has not even shed a single tear over the divorce</a> and wants fans to know that she is doing "OK".</p><p>Cardi B has made it clear that she wants to focus on being a mother to her 2-year-old daughter, and of course, her career, which is currently the hottest it has ever been. With the success of "WAP", alongside Megan Thee Stallion, Cardi B has nothing but great things coming her way.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>How Tall Is Cardi B (& 9 Other Things You Didn't Know About Her)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilqGWgp7Kvwc9mn6ivXaLCpLSMsKClpF2YrrOwyGaZZqCRq7JuwM5mp5qxXaSzp7%2FErWSapZmZeqW11aipnJ1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./g-monty-brinson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>G Monty Brinson Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
