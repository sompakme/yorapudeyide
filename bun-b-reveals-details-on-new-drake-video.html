Bun B says it was only a matter time–a lot of time–when him and Drake would film the video for “Put It Down.” The next visual from Bun Trill OG LP was shot last month in Houston during a rare break in Drizzy’s schedule.

“It was difficult. It was something since we recorded, Drake was always down to shoot the video,” Bun explained a few days ago in H-Town."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It was something since we recorded, Drake was always down to shoot the video,” Bun explained a few days ago in H-Town. “But of course, he’s one of the most popular people in the world right now, so he didn’t have too much free time. It was no way to get him out of what he was doing between press and corporate engagements and touring.”</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After trying to gel schedules earlier this year, the two finally settled in on October when Drake’s “Light Dreams and Nightmare” outing brought him to the city of syrup.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“We’re both working people. We end up in the same city sometimes, but it’s usually not with enough time to coordinate shooting a music video,” said Bun who actually made a guest stage appearance at a Drake “Light Dreams…” Miami date in September. “Unless you’ve got Spiff TV, it’s difficult to make it happen on the fly.”</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In the interim, Bun kept the momentum for his LP going with videos such as “Trillionaire”, “Counting money all day” and “Riding Slow”.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>True to what was teased in the video’s trailer last week, “Put It Down” focuses on performance and partying.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Time was short so we didn’t want to have a narrative we couldn’t stick to and the video not be cohesive,” the Port Arthur legend explained.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As for Pimp C’s whip that Drake rap’s about on the song, Bun says it was a poetic scenario, but Drizzy actually didn’t purchase the late street icon’s ride.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“He did try to buy Pimp’s red drop,” Bun said. “Several people tried to buy Pimp’s red drop. Its’ preserved right now. They put it up. It’s really a show car not to be driven. I know Cee-Lo wanted to buy it and preserve it, put it in his car collection. I heard Pain wanted it. It was originally Chamillionaire’s car. And Pimp was like ‘I want that car.’ Chamillionaire was like ‘I want a verse and a beat.’</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The video for “Put It Down” should debut within the next several days.<strong> – Shaheem Reid</strong></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5fCr3nBZqmerpWWubR5w56rmqGcqHqvsdZmm6uZm5p6t7XDnqZmamRqfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./benjamin-edwards-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Benjamin Edwards Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
