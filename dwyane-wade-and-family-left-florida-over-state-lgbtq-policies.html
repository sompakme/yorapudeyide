Having Wade County is great. But my family&nbsp;would not be accepted or feel comfortable there. And so that’s one of the reasons why I don’t live there.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1385879882.jpeg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Dwyane Wade’s <a href=#>15-year-old daughter</a> Zaya Wade came out as transgender in 2020. The <a href=#>NBA Hall Of Fame</a> inductee and his wife, actress Gabrielle Union have publicly accepted and protected the teenager, often <a href=#>being recognized</a> for speaking up for the LGBTQ community.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I&nbsp;tell my dad&nbsp;all the time, I’m just a mirror image of the way he loved us and the way that he accepted not only myself and my brothers but other kids in the community that didn’t have father figures,” he explained to Nichols.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“And so I don’t know any difference. And so yes, I had to educate myself and yes, I had to get a better understanding. And yes, I had to lose some friends along the process, but I never wavered on loving my kids and trying to find space to get the chance to understand them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1351318407.jpeg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In March 2022, the Florida Senate&nbsp;passed the Parental Rights in Education Bill, which is often referred to as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. <a rel=nofollow href=#>NPR</a> reported the bill was signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis, officially prohibiting public school teachers from discussing sexual orientation or gender in the classroom.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards,” reads the bill.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In March 2023, DeSantis expanded the law to include all grades, according to <a rel=nofollow href=#>AP News</a>. The outlet reported, “The rule change would ban lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity from grades 4 to 12 unless required by existing state standards or as part of reproductive health instruction that students can choose not to take.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5nEuq3NnmSwmZSaeq671Z5kn6Sfp7alrYylnpusoWK9sLjInKCeq11mf3SAlm5pamxiZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dean-unglert-caelynn-miller-keyes-relationship-timeline.html><span>←</span><span>Dean Unglert, Caelynn Miller-Keyes Relationship Timeline</span></a>
