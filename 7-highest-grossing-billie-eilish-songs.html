She attracted attention in 2015 with a song written and produced by her brother, <a href=#>Finneas O'Connell.</a> By the way, he cooperates with her today. Up to now, she's got Brit Awards, American <a href=#>Music Awards</a>, Grammy Awards, MTV Video Music Awards, and a <a href=#>Guinness World Record</a>. In 2019, <a href=#>Time Magazine</a> included her in its 100 Next list, and in 2021, she was included in the main Time 100 list. Billie is a lovable artist not only because of the touching texts in her songs but also because of her catchy style. She's one of the <a href=#>new-generation</a> celebrities who doesn't sell sexuality, but the opposite. She wears baggy, oversized clothing, dyes hair to crazy colors, and she's still popular and honorable.</p><p>If you wondered what made her so famous, here's the list of her <a href=#>best-selling</a> songs that made history in the 21st-century music industry.</p><h2 id=bad-guy---peaked-at-1-in-2019>Bad Guy -&nbsp;Peaked At #1 In 2019</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's the fifth and the biggest single from the debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? No wonder it received positive reviews. It's full of sarcasm and fun. And all this is done by the pop star who was still in her teens.</p><h2 id=everything-i-wanted---peaked-at-6-in-2019>Everything I Wanted -&nbsp;Peaked At #6 In 2019</h2><p>The song is inspired by a nightmare the pop star had. It's about her strong relationship with her brother, who's been protecting her too much. It's been warmly accepted by critics. Eventually, the song got nominated at the <a href=#>63rd Annual Grammy Awards </a>for Best Pop Solo Performance and Song of the Year.</p><p>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Billie Eilish Collaborates With Nike For Vegan Air Jordan Silhouettes</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-the-party-is-over---peaked-at-14-in-2018>When The Party Is Over -&nbsp;Peaked At #14 In 2018</h2><p>The song has been streamed in the UK 138 MILLION times! It's the second single from the already mentioned When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?&nbsp;<a href=#>album</a>. The track is completely vocal with just two instruments: acoustic piano and sub-bass, which is why it was accepted by the music critics.</p><h2 id=therefore-i-am---peaked-at-2-in-2020>Therefore I Am -&nbsp;Peaked At #2 In 2020</h2><p>The second single of the second music album, Happier Than Ever, became the fourth top-10 hit in the US with five thousand downloads and 3.1 million streams. Additionally, it peaked at #1 on the singles charts in New Zealand, Ireland, Lithuania, and Greece. By the way, <a href=#>the video was randomly shot on an iPhone</a> without any crew.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bury-a-friend---peaked-at-10-in-2019>Bury A Friend -&nbsp;Peaked At #10 In 2019</h2><p>A song about a <a href=#>monster</a> under someone's bed got positive reviews due to its <a href=#>dark lyrics</a>. Additionally, the video clip involves some horror elements, which music critics found really 'creepy' and 'haunting'. Well, black latex gloves, syringes, eyes turning black - that's made an impression for sure.</p><p>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Ticket Prices For Billie Eilish UK Tour Elicits Anger From Fans</a></p><h2 id=wish-you-were-gay---peaked-at-12-on-2019>Wish You Were Gay -&nbsp;Peaked At #12 On 2019</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is a jazz-inspired pop song that might've confused Billie's fans. Or, the phrase, "I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay/ I just kinda wish you were gay," specifically. But her <a href=#>LGBTQ fans claimed</a> she was queerbaiting the audience and fetishizing gay men. "The whole idea of the song is, it's kind of a joke," said the pop star. Well, the title was created when she was just 14 years old. Nevertheless, the song has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America despite the <a href=#>backlash</a>.</p><h2 id=no-time-to-die---peaked-at-1-in-2020>No Time To Die -&nbsp;Peaked At #1 In 2020</h2><p>A theme song for the <a href=#>James Bond film</a> makes Billie the youngest artist who has written and recorded it; she was just 18 years old at that time. The song won the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billie Eilish made history thanks to being an authentic self. She managed to create herself a name in the music industry, collaborate in the fashion industry, and make ads with other companies, like Adobe Creative Cloud and <a href=#>Apple</a>.
