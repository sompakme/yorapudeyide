Not only is it a bestseller on Amazon, but it’s been the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Swiss Colony’s single most popular gift box</a> for years. It’s the ultimate sampler, featuring a large variety of cheeses, sausages and sweet treats. 27 types, to be exact (more than 27 individual pieces overall)!</p><p>So, what’s included? First there are three types of shelf-stable summer sausages: original, garlic and caraway. Then come the three types of cheeses: cheddar, brick and Colby. Don’t forget the cheese spreads, fruit spreads and mustards!
