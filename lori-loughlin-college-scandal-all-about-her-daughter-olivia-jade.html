Fellow actress <a href=#><strong>Felicity Huffman</strong></a>, who shares two daughters with husband <strong><a href=#>William H. Macy,</a></strong> has also been arrested for her alleged role in the scandal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lori-Loughlin%E2%80%99s-College-Admissions-Scandal-5-Things-to-Know-About-Her-Daughter-Olivia-Jade.jpg><p>In addition to Olivia, Loughlin and Mossimo are parents of 20-year-old Bella, an aspiring actress who is also studying at USC.</p><p>Here’s five things to know about Olivia:</p><p><strong>1. She’s a YouTuber</strong><br>Olivia launched her YouTube channel back in August 2014 and has gained nearly 2 million subscribers in four years. The influencer’s videos include makeup tutorials, clothing hauls and vlogs about her college life. Some of Olivia’s most popular videos feature her mother. Loughlin’s Full House costar <a href=#><strong>John Stamos</strong></a> even made a cameo in a December 2018 video about teaching parents “slang” terms.</p><p>Olivia has also collaborated with a lot of other popular YouTubers including<strong> David Dobrik, Trisha Paytas </strong>and<strong> Emma Chamberlain.</strong></p><p>In addition to her 1.9 million YouTube subscribers, Olivia has 1.3 million Instagram followers and 181k Twitter followers.</p><p><strong>2. She Works With Sephora</strong><br>Olivia launched her Olivia Jade x Sephora Collection Bronze & Illuminate Palette in December 2018. After the bronzer and highlighter set sold out on December 26, the makeup brand restocked the product.</p><p><strong>3. She Has a Clothing Line</strong><br>She worked with online shopping website Princess Polly in November 2018 on an exclusive clothing line. Olivia’s designs, including cropped tops, jeans and sweaters, are still available for purchase.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/olivia-jade.jpg><p><strong>4.

She’s Faced Backlash</strong><br>Olivia has come under fire twice in recent years for her YouTube videos. Back in August 2017, the teenager promised to never vlog and drive again after she filmed herself in the car moments before she was rear-ended at a red light. Loughlin defended her daughter to <a href=#>TMZ</a> at the time. “She was not on her phone. That was all absolute BS,” the actress said.</p><p>More recently, Olivia <a href=#>was criticized for saying she went to college for “game days” and “partying”</a> in August 2018. She later apologized in a second video for her “super ignorant and stupid” remarks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalp6Keeq271KCfpaGeYrCwuMuenp5lo5iur7DApWSapJxirqO71K1koZ2iYrGiwcahq56qXaS5qsLImmSjmZSafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kayvon-thibodeaux-girlfriend-is-kayvon-thibodeaux-in-a-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>Kayvon Thibodeaux Girlfriend: Is Kayvon Thibodeaux in a Relationship?</span></a>
