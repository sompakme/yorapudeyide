<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Emma Watson Reveals Subscription to Explicit Website</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Wow, Hermione! <b><a href=#>Emma Watson</a></b> has revealed that she has a secret weapon when it comes to making sure her sex life is as good as it possibly could be — and there's not a magic wand involved!</p><p><span>The former <i>Harry Potter</i> star, 25, said, during an onstage interview with feminist icon <b>Gloria Steinem</b> that she has signed up to the website OMGYES.com, which uses scientific research on female pleasure to help people get better in bed.</span></p><p>"I wish it had been around longer. Definitely check it out,” Watson (who is currently dating actor <b>Roberto Aguire</b>) told Steinem. "It's an expensive subscription, but it's worth it."</p><p><span>A rep for the site,&nbsp;</span><span>which costs $59 to subscribe to,</span><span>&nbsp;told the </span><a href=#>New York <i>Daily News</i></a><span> that they're investing millions into the research of female sexual pleasure.</span></p><p><span>"In short, scientists had never researched actual techniques for pleasure because it's so taboo,” they told the outlet. "We got $4.6 million in funding and are doing that research. Instead of just making academic journal articles, we're making the findings practical, real and experiential in the form of documentary interviews — both explicit and nonexplicit — with real-life women, not actresses."</span></p><p>Watson revealed earlier this month that she's<a href=#> taking a year off </a>of acting in order to focus on two key areas of her life: feminism and personal growth.</p><p>“My own personal task is to read a book a week," she said, in an interview with <i><a href=#>Paper</a></i> magazine. "I almost thought about going and doing a year of gender studies, then I realized that I was learning so much by being on the ground and just speaking with people and doing my reading,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p><span>During her interview with Steinem, she also revealed that her mission of empowerment is helping her to overcome insecurities she's had for many years.</span></p><p>"I used to hate that I had strong eyebrows. As a 9-year-old I desperately wanted to pluck them and make them two thin lines," she said. "My mother desperately tried to tell me that they gave my face character, don't be ashamed."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaepZ2Werit06ymp2WimsOmrcusZKytkqiws7XPraCopl2pvG6x16mjopuZqXq4scGsoK2dXax%2Bd4GScWpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ellen-degeneres-through-the-years-from-comedian-to-talk-show-host.html><span>←</span><span>Ellen DeGeneres Through the Years: From Comedian to Talk Show Host</span></a>
