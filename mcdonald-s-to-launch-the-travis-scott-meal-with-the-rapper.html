It will cost approximately $6.</p><p>“I couldn’t be more excited to bring the Cactus Jack x McDonald’s collaboration to life,” Scott, 28, said in a statement. “We are bringing together two iconic worlds. Including a charitable component was key for me, and I can’t wait for people to see what we have in store.”</p><p>As <a href=#>the “Butterfly Effect” rapper</a> implied, his limited-edition meal will also give back to others by “exploring opportunities to support charitable organizations during the month-long program.”</p><p>Additionally, Cactus Jack has designed custom apparel for McDonald’s crew.</p><p>The Texas native has been teasing this collaboration for weeks and confirmed the news on Thursday when he tweeted a photo of McDonald’s French fries. “CACTUS JACK FOR MCDONALD’S,” he wrote along with the snapshot.</p><p>Scott is only the second celebrity to ever have his name featured on the McDonald’s menu. The first was basketball legend <a href=#><strong>Michael Jordan</strong></a>, who joined forces with the fast-food chain in 1992 to release the McJordan Special value meal.</p><p>“Travis is a true McDonald’s fan, having grown up visiting our restaurants in Houston, not to mention one of the biggest musical acts and cultural icons in the world,” Morgan Flatley, McDonald’s U.S. chief marketing officer, explained. “This is the first time in nearly 30 years we’ve introduced a superstar’s name to our menu – we’re excited to bring the ‘Travis Scott Meal’ to a McDonald’s near you starting next week.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>To snag the “Travis Scott Meal,” fans can order it in-restaurant, for carry-out, at the drive thru or via the McDonald’s app starting on Tuesday, September 8.</p><p>This isn’t the first food collaboration Scott has participated in. In June 2019, he<a href=#> teamed up with Reese’s Puffs cereal</a> to release a limited-edition box as well as some themed apparel for the brand. That venture proved to be a smashing success, as the cereal boxes sold out less than 30 seconds after they went on sale.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqablKS7orjDrGStp12hrra6wqFkraCVYsGzrdWiqmark6TBtXnMnpilZaeewal506GcZqqRpb2mvo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./martin-scorsese-becoming-a-hollywood-legend.html><span>←</span><span>Martin Scorsese: Becoming A Hollywood Legend</span></a>
