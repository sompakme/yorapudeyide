Less than two years later,&nbsp;they wed in front of a global audience in an event known as The Royal Wedding. Earlier this year, Meghan gave birth to their first child, a baby boy named Archie!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Times Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds Were Relationships Goals&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>Despite the short time that Harry and Meghan, now known formally as The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have been together, they've had quite the whirlwind romance. One that the world is totally enraptured by.&nbsp;To celebrate, here are ten times that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were&nbsp;relationship&nbsp;goals.</p><h2 id=the-time-meghan-posted-spooning-bananas>The Time Meghan Posted Spooning Bananas</h2><p>Before Meghan Markle did away with her personal social media accounts,&nbsp;to adhere to royal protocol, she frequently updated Instagram with snapshots of her personal life.</p><p>There was a brief period early in her relationship with Prince Harry, when she wanted to commemorate their time together, but couldn't actually post about them. To get around that, she posted a picture of spooning bananas with happy faces, which the public later found to be symbolic of her relationship with Harry. How sweet!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harry-surprised-meghan-in-toronto>Harry Surprised Meghan In Toronto</h2><p>Before Meghan Markle became the Duchess of Sussex, she was the lead actress on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Suits</a>, a legal drama. Meghan announced her departure from the show, of which she was a cast member for seven seasons, shortly after she and Prince Harry went public.</p><p>Prior to leaving the show, however, Meghan was spending much of her time in Toronto, where Suits was filmed. And before the public&nbsp;was ever formally let in on&nbsp;their relationship, Harry flew up to Canada to surprise Meghan! No one—especially not the press—could know about the trip, so Harry traveled with minimal security to keep things low-key. The news got out anyway, but it's the thought that counts.</p><h2 id=the-not-so-secret-halloween-party>The Not-So-Secret Halloween Party</h2><p>Getting surprised by the person you're falling in love with is every girl's dream come true, but Harry also did Meghan one better during this trip. Instead of Harry using his status as a Prince to strong arm Meghan into solely doing what he wanted, he proved to her that he was eager to mingle with her own inner circle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> 10 Times Melissa McCarthy And Frank Falcone Were Relationship Goals</a></span></p><p>During Harry's trip, he crashed a Halloween party hosted by Meghan's friends. They also went trick or treating together. If you're wondering how they managed to keep this all under wraps, he pair, apparently, pulled this off by disguising themselves in costumes.</p><h2 id=the-first-time-harry-defended-meghan>The First Time&nbsp;Harry Defended Meghan</h2><p>No matter how much progress we've made in the world, there are still people who are hung up on Meghan's biracial heritage. When you pair that with the world's obsession with Prince Harry's love life, you can imagine that rumors that he was dating Meghan Markle inspired a media storm.</p><p>It was the press's obsession with Harry and Meghan's relationship that prompted Harry to put out a statement which both confirmed their courtship and defended Meghan (and her mother) at the same time. It's sad that it had to be done, but his attempt to protect her was beyond admirable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-they-got-cozy-at-the-invictus-games>When They Got Cozy At&nbsp;The Invictus Games</h2><p>The Invictus Games, which Prince Harry created, is an international sporting event that features injured military veterans competing against each other in various sports. An event honoring vets and officers will always be special, but the 2017 games were an extra special milestone for Harry and Meghan's&nbsp;relationship.</p><p>It was the first time that the couple made a public appearance together following Prince Harry's confirmation of their relationship.&nbsp;During the games, Harry and Meghan snuggled close to each other, smiled, and even shared their first public kiss!</p><h2 id=when-they-camped-out-in-botswana>When They Camped Out In Botswana</h2><p>If you've ever seen Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, Lifetime's fictional take on Harry and Meghan's relationship, then you know that it depicted the couple taking a trip to Botswana. It was a place with sentimental significance to Prince Harry and his road to healing after Princess Diana's death.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Times Nick Jonas And Priyanka Chopra Were Friends</a></span></p><p>Well, that part of the film was based on a trip Harry actually took Meghan on! This was more of a bonding trip, than one of luxury, as he and Meghan camped out in what Harry described as the middle of nowhere. Needless to say, this venture out into nature helped solidify their bond. Because they were engaged not long after.</p><h2 id=the-first-sit-down-interview>The&nbsp;First Sit-Down Interview</h2><p>Harry and Meghan announced their engagement in the fall of 2017. Days later, their first sit-down interview as a couple was released. Sitting side-by-side, hand-in-hand, Harry and Meghan recounted the romantic details of their engagement.</p><p>Apparently, Harry proposed to Meghan while they were at their shared home, cooking dinner. Caught by the surprise, Meghan couldn't say yes fast enough. The only thing sweeter than the simple nature of their proposal were the smiles on their faces as they told the story!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-they-released-their-engagement-photos>When They Released Their Engagement Photos</h2><p>Harry and Meghan&nbsp;posed for photos when they announced their engagement, but official professional photos weren't released until about a month later. The wait was definitely worth it because the photos are still talked about to this day.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Richest Family Dynasties in History</a></span></p><p>The money shot, however, was the photo&nbsp;of Meghan cradling Harry's face, with her custom-made engagement ring on full display. Ah, to be rich and in love.</p><h2 id=prince-harry-teared-up-during-their-wedding>Prince Harry Teared Up During Their Wedding</h2><p>It was the cry seen around the world! Everyone who tuned into the Royal Wedding, in May 2018, saw Prince Harry tear&nbsp;for Meghan during their ceremony.</p><p>Tears are expected at weddings, but there's something&nbsp;insanely adorable&nbsp;about seeing Harry break royal form and allow himself to be vulnerable.&nbsp;So it really was the perfect moment to commemorate such a beautiful day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harry-fixed-meghan-s-ponytail>Harry Fixed Meghan's Ponytail</h2><p>Romance doesn't always need to be signified by grand, sweeping gestures. Sometimes, it's the small intimate moments that really make a relationship great. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been witnessed sharing several of those moments, but one of the cutest happened earlier this season.</p><p>During Harry and Meghan's trip to Cape Cod, Harry was caught on video fixing Meghan's&nbsp;ponytail for her. Royal or not, perfectly-coiffed hair is important when you're in the public eye, so we're sure Meghan appreciated the helping hand!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Times Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Were Relationship Goals</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5noKe2r6%2FEZp%2BaqqKueq6xxqGYp2Wdlr%2BsuMRmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZZekrq2%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lsu-star-flau-jae-johnson-raps-in-front-of-fans-after-ncaa-title-win.html><span>←</span><span> LSU Star Flau'Jae Johnson Raps In Front Of Fans After NCAA Title Win</span></a>
