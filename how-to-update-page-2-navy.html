Typically, this occurs when a member uses their personal vehicle to ship household items as they move from one duty station to the next. This type of move will require full/empty weight tickets of the vehicle.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-will-military-movers-not-pack></span>What will military movers not pack?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>And they are liable for that. Same goes for batteries, which <b>could</b> leak acid, or things that <b>could</b> melt into liquid like candles. For that reason, your local <b>military</b> transportation office <b>will</b> probably warn you that the <b>movers will not pack</b> food, batteries, candles and more.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-the-navy-move-my-car></span>Can the Navy move my car?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Does</b> the military <b>ship your car</b> for free? The military may <b>ship your car</b> for free if you’re an a) active member of the military and b) have received permanent change of station (PCS) orders. The government only pays for one personal operating <b>vehicle</b> (POV) to be shipped, according to the Department of Defense.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-the-military-pay-for-you-to-move></span>Does the military pay for you to move?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In a DITY <b>move</b>, the government will reimburse <b>you</b> 95% of what it would cost them to <b>move</b> up to your maximum authorized weight allowance (determined by <b>pay</b> grades and dependents) and supply $25,000 of insurance coverage. A Dislocation Allowance (DLA) can be <b>paid</b> to <b>military</b> personnel as part of their <b>move</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-does-the-navy-pay-you-to-move></span>How much does the Navy pay you to move?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The MALT is the amount <b>paid</b> when a member and/or the member’s family drive to their new duty station, based on the Official Military Table of Distances. How is it figured? MALT is <b>paid</b> at the rate of $0.16 a mile based on the official distance between duty stations.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=will-the-military-pay-for-my-wife-to-move></span>Will the military pay for my wife to move?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Timing Is Important. Timing <b>can</b> be important in a <b>military</b> marriage. If you have PCS (Permanent Change of Station) orders and get married before you actually make the <b>move</b>, you <b>can</b> have your <b>spouse</b> added to your orders and the <b>military will pay</b> for the relocation of your <b>spouse</b> and <b>her</b> property (furniture and such).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-do-military-move-every-3-years></span>Why do military move every 3 years?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Most “tours” of duty only last 2–<b>3 years</b>, then they are re-assigned to another location. There are many reasons they <b>do</b> this, but the main one is security. If personnel are constantly changing locations, then there is less of a chance to get precise numbers of personnel at any one location.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-your-wife-go-with-you-on-deployments></span>Can your wife go with you on deployments?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Unfortunately, <b>the</b> whole idea <b>of</b> visiting <b>your spouse</b> during <b>deployment</b> is highly unlikely. There’s <b>a</b> reason <b>the</b> military isn’t sending <b>you</b> with them! If <b>you</b> were to be truly flexible enough to jump on <b>a</b> plane whenever <b>your spouse</b> says “<b>Go</b>,” <b>you would</b> still have <b>a</b> horribly priced plane ticket.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=will-the-military-move-my-family></span>Will the military move my family?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In the <b>military</b>, a <b>PCS move</b> stands for Permanent Change of Station. The <b>military will</b> pay them to relocate their <b>family</b> and their belongings to the new station. A <b>PCS move can</b> be stressful and exhausting, but it is a regular occurrence for most <b>military families</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-it-called-when-the-military-moves-you></span>What is it called when the military moves you?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Military</b> PCS and <b>Relocation</b>. There are three main types of stateside <b>military moves</b> — <b>moves you</b> do yourself, <b>known as</b> “personally procured <b>moves</b>” (PPM) or do-it-yourself (DITY), relocations <b>you</b> let the <b>military</b> hire movers for, and <b>moves</b> done as a combination of the two, <b>known as</b> a partial-PPM or a partial-DITY.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6trzDmqueZaCWtKZ5kWalmq6pYn9w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebs-in-pantone-color-of-the-year-2018-ultra-violet-rihanna-more.html><span>←</span><span>Celebs in Pantone Color of the Year 2018 Ultra Violet: Rihanna, More</span></a>
