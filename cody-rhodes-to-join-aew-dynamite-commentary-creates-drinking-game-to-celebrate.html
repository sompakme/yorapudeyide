For every time Cody says “Wait a minute…” during his time on commentary, fans take a drink. If he says it more than once in a row, fans chug their drink for five seconds. Needless to say, it should be a night filled with tons of drink, as Rhodes has a knack for dropping that infamous line when he speaks. You can check out the festivities tomorrow night on AEW Dynamite.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBwb3JvaGKwsLDYZqmhp5SawG7AzmahqKGeYq6mw4ydsKeZnZ7BpnnCqKSmnZ6prrPFjJypnpmkmsBusNGipaShnpx6qK3MnmStp12Ysq2xwauYrZ0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brendon-zub-net-worth-married-age-wiki-biography-parents-wife-height.html><span>←</span><span>Brendon Zub Net Worth, Married, Age, Wiki, Biography, Parents, Wife, Height</span></a>
