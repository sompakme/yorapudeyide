The former singer debuted her new brunette look on her Instagram page in a video, crediting her younger sister Jamie Lynn Spears for the inspiration.</p><p>While she may have struggled with various issues in the past, Spears is sporting a much healthier, down-to-earth look in the photo, which didn’t escape the notice of her boyfriend of three years, Sam Asghari. There’s also a bit of potential new jewelry being discussed, as Asghari mentioned marriage is a definite goal of his and Britney’s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-simpson>Jessica Simpson</h2><p>Former pop starlet Jessica Simpson still rocks her platinum blonde hair but has shed some weight after the birth of her third child. She recently shared with fans that she has lost 100 pounds just six months after giving birth, and credits her success to hard work and strict routines.</p><p>She follows a healthy diet and tracks her steps, with a minimum goal of 14,000 each day. This works out to roughly seven miles, and it has proven very effective for Simpson. Her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">personal trainer</a> even commented that she wished all her clients had Simpson’s positive attitude and work ethic.</p><h2 id=mariah-carey>Mariah Carey</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mariah Carey</a> is one of those pop divas who doesn’t let you forget about her, as she is still touring today. If you look at a timeline of her style from the 1990s on, there really isn’t much change to speak of, but for Mariah that isn’t a bad thing.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Ridiculously Expensive Things That Sylvester Stallone Bought</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mariah’s style is sleek, classy body-con dresses, usually black with a little bling. Other than some subtle modern touches, her look is still much the same. It’s safe to say that time has been kind to Mariah Carey, as she is as radiant today as she was at the beginning of her career.</p><h2 id=madonna>Madonna</h2><p>Madonna is one of those stars who always keeps you on your toes in terms of her style, which has changed drastically over the years. She is known for her wild clothing choices, some of which omitted whole areas of fabric most would consider critical and has a very dynamic sense of style.</p><p>While her face has changed a bit over time since the release of past hits such as “Material Girl,” this superstar’s age will still shock you. At 61 years of age, Madonna is still very much the style icon we have grown accustomed to and pulls everything off flawlessly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=janet-jackson>Janet Jackson</h2><p>Pop diva <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Janet Jackson </a>may have had some awkwardly timed wardrobe malfunctions in the past, but these days her look is a bit more consciously chosen. The singer recently presented an award to fellow diva Rihanna sporting a Stella McCartney jacket and tuxedo ensemble with faux fur and chose to keep only one outfit on for the duration of the night.</p><p>This effort to reduce consumption and waste makes her a welcomed addition to the green living conversation. Her outfit choices may vary, but her iconic vibe is still very much the same as it was in her performing heyday.</p><h2 id=cher>Cher</h2><p>Cher doesn’t need to turn back time: she makes herself very much as relevant today as she was a decade ago. Her style is so unique and dynamic that it’s really hard to say that it’s changed over time. Feathers, bold patterns, sequins, and gemstones are all critical pieces to her outfit choices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her concert costumes are her boldest displays of self-expression. Looking at her now, you’d have no idea that Cher has been performing since the 1960s, but she still knows how to put on a stellar show. Her bold looks served as inspiration for many artists to follow. Here she is seen performing in 2019 (at 73!) in her Here We go Again tour.</p><h2 id=shakira>Shakira</h2><p>Former pop singer Shakira has traded the concert tour life for a little acting in movies, and her look has changed quite a bit in the process. The Colombian star formerly sported her naturally curly hair in various styles; while it remains nearly the same shade of honey blonde, she recently had a straightening treatment to showcase her new look in her upcoming concert movie <i>Shakira in concert: The El Dorado World Tour</i>.</p><p>It’s a pretty drastic difference, but she really pulls it off well. She may have changed highlights over the years, but Shakira’s classic iconic look has survived well over time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lopez>Jennifer Lopez</h2><p>Once she hit her stride in her career, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lopez</a> quickly became a style icon whose look is always changing, and this remains true today. Her hair is always styled, and her outfits are always red carpet-worthy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Hustler: 10 Most Expensive Outfits Jennifer Lopez Has Worn</a></span></p><p>Her style choices range from low-cut to high-cut, some outfits managing both at once, and always at least a little shiny. Her more recent dress made of mirrored pieces really allowed her style to shine. Even now at 50, she is still wowing the crowds at her shows, but no matter what she’s wearing, Jennifer Lopez is sure to look amazing in whatever it is.</p><h2 id=christina-aguilera>Christina Aguilera</h2><p>Always full of surprises, singer and talent show judge Christina Aguilera has mixed up her classic style in recent times. She typically favored ensembles and looks that featured lots of sparkle and glitter with an edge, including sparkly makeup accents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, at a recent awards show, the singer chose to debut a much more natural look, letting her natural features shine. She completed the simplified look with slicked-back hair, another change from her usual up-dos. It’s a refreshing change from her slightly edgy styles of the past, but she still isn’t afraid to accessorize with some pearls or well-placed feathers.</p><h2 id=shania-twain>Shania Twain</h2><p><a href=#>Shania Twain</a> was a bit reflective about her own style recently, as she compared her current look to the one she sported at her first major awards show in 1996. Always classy and a little flashy, Shania’s style has matured with her over the years, and she is thankful for this.</p><p>She feels she is more comfortable in her own skin, far more so now than she was back then, and her look reflects this with bolder style choices. At a recent performance in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Las Vegas</a>, she donned a neon orange bodysuit and hot pink robe to belt out some hits, radiant in her own unique way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Most Expensive Houses For Sale In South America in 2019</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nkqe2tbrEsmSsqJWWv7R5yZ6qrKGTlnq0tcypqqimXZu8s7POrauepl2iwrS1wmaboq6RqHq4tMCtZK2gla56rbvOpGSloZuaeq%2B71mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shop-the-best-formal-jewelry-under-500-that-looks-over-500.html><span>←</span><span>Shop the Best Formal Jewelry Under $500 That Looks Over $500</span></a>
