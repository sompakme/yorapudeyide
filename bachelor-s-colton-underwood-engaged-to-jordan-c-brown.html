Us Weekly confirmed their romance in November 2021, but Underwood chose to keep their relationship off camera while filming the Netflix series.</p><p>“I have been through that. I have done that,” he exclusively told Us in December 2021. “Even going into the show, that was one of the conversations with the production company. … I’m not in a space right now to really, like, put myself out there like that. I had a lot of self-discovery to do.”</p><p>He added: “Having a public relationship, for me, was not healthy. I just think right now I’m really sort of protecting and guarding what I have.”</p><p>Ahead of his romance with Brown, Underwood competed on season 14 of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>, vying for <a href=#><strong>Becca Kufrin</strong></a>’s heart.

I’m sorry for any pain and emotional stress I caused. I wish that it wouldn’t have happened the way that it did. I wish that I had been courageous enough to fix myself before I broke anybody else.”</p><p>Before the Indiana native’s engagement made headlines, <a href=#>he exclusively told Us</a> how he felt about his then-boyfriend.</p><p>“I’m happy, I’m in love and I’m in a good position,” he said in December 2021, confirming that his family had met Brown. “Everything as far as that goes has been pretty smooth.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Randolph, for her part, is <a href=#>dating <strong>Brighton Reinhardt</strong></a>. The twosome were first linked in August 2020.</p><p>“We’re doing great. We were friends for a really long time before we started dating so I kind of feel like that helped us out just in so many different ways,” the speech and language therapist told Us in December 2021. “So we just have a lot of fun together. He’s like my best friend.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270axknKecqbyvedSnm56qp6S8pXnEp56an5WZerW7jKOmq5yRo3qkecGrprCmXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-trevor-siemian-wife-or-girlfriend-salary-and-net-worth-is-he-married.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Trevor Siemian Wife or Girlfriend?
