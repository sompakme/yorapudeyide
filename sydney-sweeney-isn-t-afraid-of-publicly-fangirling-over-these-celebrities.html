She's already said that her fans, and even her family, <a href=#>don't understand her</a>. This is due to her A-list status, something those groups of people don't have in common with her. She still is a person at the end of the day. She is unique and has her own preferences. For instance, Sydney doesn't drink coffee, opting for water and candy instead.</p><p>Something Sydney does have in common with fans is that she can be quite obsessed with some things. Most girls her age can be quite obsessive over various celebrities, and from that perspective, she truly is no different.</p><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-39-s-obsession-with-zendaya><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Sydney Sweeney's Obsession With Zendaya</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sydney is straight-up obsessed with her A-list co-star.

She plays Maddie Perez on the show. Yes, Sydney also happens to be obsessed with her, too.</p><p>The two attend red-carpet events with each other and take joint selfies. Most importantly, Sydney attended an Oscars after-party with Alexa, and the two were pictured having the time of their lives. In an interview with People, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sydney said that Alexa "rocks"</a> out as an actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A funny fact about their friendship is that their characters hate each other on Euphoria. The two characters fought each other and were even nominated for "Best Fight" at the MTV Awards. Alexa actually broke Sydney's toe during that famous fight.</p><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-thinks-highly-of-alexandra-daddario><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sydney Sweeney Thinks Highly Of Alexandra Daddario</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alexandra-Daddario.jpg><p>Sydney has knocked it out of the park as Olivia in The White Lotus. The main star on that show is Alexandra Daddario, someone Sydney has really looked up to as an actress.</p><p>At the GQ Men Of The Year event in 2022, Alexandra said Sydney is the "perfect package". They're pictured together all the time, and recently re-created a scene from The White Lotus for Instagram. Both of these actresses have a lot in common, such as appearing in shows and movies for teenagers. Alexandra starred in Texas Chainsaw 3D. She once <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> the house they filmed in was definitely "haunted".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-39-s-obsession-with-the-property-brothers><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Sydney Sweeney's Obsession With The Property Brothers</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/drew-scott-jonathan-scott-property-brothers.jpg><p>It's expected that Sydney would love her co-stars, but she's also completely into a pair of reality stars.</p><p>She's admitted to being obsessed with the Property Brothers, Jonathan and Drew Scott. For those who don't know them, they're brothers who create and renovate homes on their personal reality show. Sydney admitted to "fangirling" over them when she met them at an exclusive celebrity event.</p><p>During the YouTube interview where she admitted to this, she gave an explanation as to why she was a fan of the Property Brothers. She said she grew up renovating and remodeling houses with her parents, and now that's making money she's doing it on her own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-thinks-dakota-johnson-is-hot><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Sydney Sweeney Thinks Dakota Johnson Is Hot...</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Why-Fans-Think-Sydney-Sweeney-Is-The-New-Dakota-Johnson-(3).jpg><p>Another celebrity Sydney has fangirled over is Dakota Johnson. Yes, they're also going to be co-stars in the upcoming Madame Web movie. Before that, though, Sydney was obsessed with Dakota due to her roles in the 50 Shades of Gray movies.</p><p>Sydney said in an interview with Variety that she secretly watched those films as a teenager. When she met Dakota, she was nervous and intimated by her. Sydney even called Dakota "hot".</p><h2 id=however-sydney-sweeney-39-s-real-childhood-crush-is-sonic-the-hedgehog><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>However, Sydney Sweeney's Real Childhood Crush Is Sonic The Hedgehog</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SonicTheHedgehog.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sydney's real childhood crush was truly Sonic the Hedgehog, though. She stated in an interview with MTV she was in love with the video game character as a kid, in an odd but romantic way.</p><p>Aside from a Call of Duty ad cameo, Sydney has never really appeared to be interested in gaming overall. There is certainly a love and obsession for an iconic furry character, though.</p><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-adores-alexander-mcqueen><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sydney Sweeney Adores Alexander McQueen</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-Much-Is-Sydney-Sweeney-Getting-Sued-For-By-LA-Collective.jpg><p>If you know Sydney at all, there's one thing she's undoubtedly in love with.

Recently, Sydney showed up to a London event dressed head to toe in an Alexander McQueen outfit. This isn't even the first time in the past year she wore the luxurious fashion brand to a red carpet event, as she wore an all-black Alexander McQueen suit jacket to a private event in Los Angeles. There's no doubt that she is utterly captivated by everything the designer puts out.</p><h2 id=brigitte-bardot-is-sydney-sweeney-39-s-biggest-fashion-and-beauty-role-model><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Brigitte Bardot Is Sydney Sweeney's Biggest Fashion And Beauty Role Model</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/brigitte-bardot-in-dear-brigitte.jpg><p>Sydney has admitted that, although she loves and rocks many different fashion brands, her biggest influence is an icon who's been around long before Sydney was born. She proclaimed this in an interview with Coveteur. In fact, Sydney said that she had been looking up to Brigitte Bardot since she was around 16 years old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For those who are unaware, Brigitte was one of the original beauty icons from the 1960s. She influenced pop culture with her appearances in hit movies such as Contempt and Don Juan. She was also a world-famous model, and if you look at some of her photo shoots you can definitely see some of the same poses and expressions Sydney uses in her modeling pictures.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqspyemsZuv9aenKedqWK%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF5wp6jnpqinsG6ecWroJ6mlKh6p63NoKCrpJmjtHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./santino-marella-ultimate-x-more-set-for-impact-rebellion-2023.html><span>←</span><span>Santino Marella, Ultimate X, More Set For IMPACT Rebellion 2023</span></a>
