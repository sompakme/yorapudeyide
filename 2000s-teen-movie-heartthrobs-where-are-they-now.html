News</a> in July 2019. (Not to mention his appearances in Gilmore Girls and Dawson’s Creek and starring on the first six seasons of One Tree Hill.)</p><p>“I have graduated from playing the high school heartthrob and I would be doing a disservice if I didn’t show some insight I learned along the way,” he began before referencing A Cinderella Story, which also starred Duff. “One thing you absolutely should not do is run off the field during your football game just to kiss a girl in the stands you’ve been Catfishing for weeks. You will lose your dignity and your friends and probably the game. Just wait until the game is over, OK?”</p><p>He added, “And if you go to a masquerade ball and the girl you see almost every day is wearing a small mask … and her entire face is exposed, but you still can’t recognize her, you should probably see an eye doctor!”</p><p>Murray went on to reference Freaky Friday, the 2003 film he appeared in with<a href=#><strong> Jamie Lee Curtis</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Lindsay Lohan.</strong></a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“If you have a crush on your classmates’ mom, act on it and then get rejected, don’t start dating her daughter,” he said. “There is a whole high school full of girls out there, figure it out!”</p><p>Scroll through for an update on your favorite 2000s movie stars:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq19nfXF80marnp2eYrqwwsieZKGdkafBtbTRqJmsZaedsrOxjJqpnmWknbK6ec2ormg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yigit-ucan-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Yigit Ucan Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
