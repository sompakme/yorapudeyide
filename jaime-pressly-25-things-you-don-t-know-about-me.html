The celebrity I am mistaken for is <a href=#><strong>Margot Robbie</strong></a>. It happens all the time.</p><p>4. The biggest misconception about being labeled “beautiful” is that that’s all you are and that you don’t have a brain or anything to back it up — which couldn’t be further from the truth.</p><p>5. To decompress after a long day, I like to sit outside in the backyard. I’m an outdoor cat.</p><p>6. My favorite items in my wardrobe are my hats when I’m out and about. They’re my hiding places.</p><p>7. My go-to karaoke song is “I Feel a Sin Comin’ On” by <a href=#><strong>Pistol Annies</strong></a>.</p><p>8.

Macaroni and cheese is <a href=#>my preferred comfort food</a>.</p><p>10. I <a href=#>haven’t had any embarrassing moments</a> while filming <a href=#><i>Welcome to Flatch</i></a>&nbsp;or any other project. When you do comedies, we’re trying to embarrass each other. We’re all goofballs trying to get a laugh.</p><p>11. My first job was when I was 13 and<a href=#> I worked at my mom’s dance studio</a>. I warmed up the classes for her, then she’d come in and teach.</p><p>12. <a href=#><strong>Allison Janney</strong> </a>is the most famous name in my phone.</p><p>13. The song that brings back the best memories is “Lovely Day.”</p><p>14. If I’m in L.A., you’ll<a href=#> find me at home with my boys</a> on the weekends. If I’m in North Carolina, you’ll find me sitting on a porch with my neighbors and family on the water.</p><p>15. My <a href=#>celebrity crushes</a> growing up were <a href=#><strong>Ralph Macchio</strong></a> from <i>The Karate Kid</i>&nbsp;and <strong>Rick Schroder</strong> from&nbsp;<i>Silver Spoons</i>.</p><p>16. My bedroom is my favorite spot in the house.</p><p>17. My <a href=#>favorite thing to cook</a> is homemade spaghetti.</p><p>18. When it comes to Mom, I’m proud of every episode we ever shot.</p><p>19. My alternate profession would be an interior designer.</p><p>20. The proudest moment in my career was winning an Emmy for <i>My Name Is Earl r</i>ight <a href=#>after I gave birth to my [eldest] son</a>, Dezi.</p><p>21. <a href=#>My first car</a> was a blue Honda Accord.</p><p>22. My <a href=#>advice for up-and-coming actresses</a> would be to learn the business — not just your lines, but the business: how it works, what your rights are and stay true to yourself.</p><p>23. My favorite thing about being a mom is being able to see my boys’ experience and see new things for the first time. It makes it new for me again.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>24. <i>The Alchemist</i>&nbsp;is my favorite book.</p><p>25.
