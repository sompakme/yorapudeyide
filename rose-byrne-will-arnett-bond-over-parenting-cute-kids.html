It’s very sweet and they love the little kangaroo,” she gushed on Wednesday about <a href=#>her boys’ fondness for her voiceover work</a>.</p><p class=p1>Byrne and the&nbsp;<i>Lego Masters&nbsp;</i>host, 52, costar in the “Come and Say G’day” campaign for <a href=#>Tourism Australia</a>, which hopes to encourage travelers to book upcoming getaways&nbsp;down under. While the&nbsp;<i>Instant Family&nbsp;</i>actress tackles <a href=#>the role of Ruby the souvenir kangaroo</a>, Arnett plays a toy unicorn named Louie.</p><p class=p1>“It was really fun! I was very intimidated,” Byrne told&nbsp;<i>Us</i>&nbsp;of her involvement while at the kickoff celebration in Brooklyn. “Will is obviously a renowned and gifted voice artist so I was very nervous.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “[Will is] a beast in the booth and we had fun. He just brought Louie alive. I was laughing so much. It’s hard! Those sessions are long and it’s a weird kind of energy that you put out. We had fun.”</p><p class=p1>Working with the&nbsp;<i>Like a Boss&nbsp;</i>actress <a href=#>was equally a dream for Arnett</a>, though his youngest son&nbsp;hasn’t quite grasped the concept of his dad’s voiceover career.</p><p class=p1>“The little one is 2 so he doesn’t get it, but he just recently started calling me ‘Batman,’” the Canada native — who <a href=#>played the Caped Crusader</a> in the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Lego: Batman</a>&nbsp;</i>movies — joked to&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>on Wednesday, referring to son <a href=#>Denny</a>,&nbsp;whom he shares with girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Alessandra Brawn</strong></a>. “It’s a good dynamic for us to have, I think, for him to think of me as Batman.”</p><p class=p1>Byrne replied: “That’s so cute! He gets it.”</p><p class=p1>While the&nbsp;Hollywood stars hinted that&nbsp;their Tourism Australia collaboration was “just the beginning” for mutual projects, they couldn’t help but gush over their recent visits to the island country.</p><p class=p1>“I’ve been a few times. But I feel like I’ve <a href=#>done all of the stuff that people know</a>,&nbsp;like Bondi Beach and all that stuff,” Arnett — who coparents <a href=#>sons Archie, 13, and Abel, 12,</a> with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Amy Poehler</strong></a> — added on Wednesday. “It’s pretty amazing. People talk about it for a reason. [I’ve also been to] Sydney [and] Melbourne. I’ve never been to the Great Barrier Reef, that’s my next bucket list place.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Annie&nbsp;</i>actress, for her part, feels “very spoiled” that <a href=#>she was able to grow up in Oz</a>. “It’s hard for me to really compare another beach in the world [to Australia’s],” she gushed to&nbsp;<i>Us.</i>&nbsp;“And recently I traveled to Uluru. It’s an absolutely extraordinary, very special,&nbsp;spiritual, sacred place.”</p><p class=p4><i>With reporting by Diana Cooper</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGarp6OaeqPF0aecZq%2BZoblurdGnnK2sXZe8r7CMqK2eql2lrrOxza2gp59dmMK1sYykoJ2rXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./olivia-munn-opens-up-about-aaron-rodgers-and-his-family-drama.html><span>←</span><span>Olivia Munn Opens Up About Aaron Rodgers and His Family Drama</span></a>
