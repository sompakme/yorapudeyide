This is the lasagna. This is amazing.”</p><p>Kroy, 37, chimed in, “Unreal.” Kim and Kroy also shared a toast with restaurant management.</p><p>Kim and Kroy married in 2011 and share children Kroy “KJ” Jr., 12, Kash, 11, and twins Kaia and Kane, 9. Kroy also adopted Kim’s eldest daughters — Brielle, 26, and Ariana, 22 — following their nuptials. Both Kim and Kroy <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> in May.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Kim-and-Kroy-Celebrate-Anniversary.jpg><p>Court docs obtained by Us Weekly at the time listed the pair’s date of separation as April 30. The split quickly got messy. Kim requested to have Kroy <a href=#>drug-tested</a> and alleged that she she had “serious concerns” for the kids’ safety. Kroy, who was seeking <a href=#>sole custody of their children,</a> alleged that Kim had a gambling problem and needed a <a href=#>psychological evaluation</a>.</p><p>Despite all the drama, it seemed like they worked out their differences when they <a href=#>called off their divorce</a> in July. However, their reconciliation was short-lived. Kroy <a href=#>filed for divorce again</a> in August, seeking full custody of their children, alimony, child support and exclusive use of their Atlanta-area home.</p><p>Weeks later, Kim took to Instagram to claim that they were fine. “I’m living here [and] not going anywhere! Been working on our marriage and have been living as husband and wife,” she shared via Instagram Story on September 8.</p><p>Days later, a source <a href=#>exclusively told Us</a> that the couple are “all over the place,” adding, “It’s a constant yo-yo that never seems to end.”</p><p>Kim claimed in court documents later that month that she and Kroy <a href=#>had sex several times</a> since filing for divorce in May. Kroy’s legal team, however, fired back by saying he <a href=#>still wanted a divorce</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The fact that he engaged in sexual relations with [Kim] does not indicate a desire to reconcile,” Kroy’s September court documents stated. “[Kroy], after this second filing, remains steadfast in his desire to leave [Kim], leave the marital residence, with the children, and provide a home for them that is calm and stable; the opposite of their current environment.”</p><p>They seemed to be on friendlier terms last month when Kroy accompanied Kim to Los Angeles for a <a href=#>vaginal rejuvenation procedure</a>.</p><p>“Kroy came with her to help her out. It’s a big surgery,” a source exclusively told Us at the time while acknowledging that the exes’ have a “bizarre” bond. “They’re going through a divorce, talk badly about each other, then travel together.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ1ix7C4wqKYpGWRo7Fut9GosGaamZq%2Frq3Np2Seppqkxm6tzaegr52iqK6zxYydoKemlad6pbHSqaCtnV2Ztre70ZycaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kanye-west-s-parents-shared-an-extremely-complicated-relationship-before-and-after-his-fame.html><span>←</span><span>Kanye West's Parents Shared An Extremely Complicated Relationship Before And After His Fame</span></a>
