A fan ran up on Hov during the Dallas Cowboys and Los Angeles Chargers&nbsp;Monday Night Football&nbsp;game on Oct. 16, and told the businessman that they would take the money instead of the meal. Jay appeared unmoved after the exchange.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Hey Hov, I’m taking that $500,000,” Ruthlessrich shared on his Instagram. “I ain’t taking that dinner, I’m taking that $500,000. You feel me? Aye, it’s love though.” Jay then responded, “Be good, man.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The fan referenced the age-old “Dinner or $500,000” meme, as social media users have debated the question for years. Historically, a lot of users have opted to take the dining experience over the bread.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Another meme was alluded to during the NFL showdown between the Chargers and Cowboys. Legendary Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman called the game and referenced the internet meme stating he looks like Hov.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“JAY-Z is in the house, reaching for a refreshment,” he says watching Jay. “Yeah,<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> there’s a meme</a> that’s going around, people think that’s my doppelgänger, you know? Me and JAY-Z, how ’bout that?”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In early October, Troy addressed the meme for the first time. During a&nbsp;Pablo Torre Finds Out&nbsp;episode, the show’s host detailed his conversation with the&nbsp;NFL&nbsp;legend. Pablo explained that he asked the former Dallas Cowboy about the meme, stating he looks like “white JAY-Z.” After an initial pause, Aikman gave a stern “yes.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Yes. I am aware of that,” Aikman could be heard saying in the recorded audio. “White JAY-Z. There was a meme, it still pops up on my feed from time to time. It was some game, yeah, I don’t know what… I think this was before everything kinda went AI. But, [now]<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#><strong>&nbsp;</strong>you don’t know what’s real</a>&nbsp;and what’s not, so I don’t know if that was actually an unedited picture of me, but,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>pretty scary.”</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2BuunnZZqmemZOpwG6ywKdknaGeo7Kzec6rZG5oYKB6cn6SbW9pamlrf3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hnic-how-old-is-kyle-bukauskas-age-wikipedia-net-worth-wife-details.html><span>←</span><span>HNIC: How Old Is Kyle Bukauskas Age?
