His parents were Italian-American, and he was raised in the Little Italy district of Manhattan. Scorsese's parents, Charles and Catherine, worked part-time as actors, which sparked Martin's interest in movies. As Scorsese had asthma, he had limited childhood activities. Scorsese was more into television and movie theatre than sports as a child. At eight years old, he drew his storyboards, complete with the line "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">directed and produced by Martin Scorsese</a>."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Raised as a devout Catholic, Scorsese had entertained the idea of joining priesthood before he chose to pursue filmmaking. His parents did not understand <a href=#>his mania for movies</a>, but Scorsese felt he was doing the right thing when a 10-minute comedy short earned him a $500 scholarship to New York University. After completing his degree, Scorsese continued at New York University as an instructor in basic film techniques and criticism.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>How Benedict Cumberbatch Became A Hollywood Star And Built His Empire</a></span></p><h2 id=the-directorial-debut-and-subsequent-move-to-hollywood>The Directorial Debut And Subsequent Move To Hollywood</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His first feature film was <i>Who's That Knocking At My Door</i>. It was first released in 1969 and introduced Harvey Keitel as the lead actor. Scorsese then frequently worked with Keitel in the following years. He cast his mother and also acted himself in some of his films. Scorsese was upset with the killing of four Kent State student protesters of the Vietnam War and war in general. He formed a group with some of his students called the New York Cinetracks Collective to film student protests against the conflict. This resulted in a film named <i>Street Scenes</i>, which was shown at the 1970 New York Film Festival. This led to the US withdrawing troops from Vietnam and the end of the Reserve Officers Training Corps on all US college campuses.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scorsese reached Hollywood in the 1970s</a>. There, he directed all kinds of films. He did feature films, documentaries, and all other stuff in the realms of Hollywood. Boxcar Bertha in 1972 paved the way for the blooming of his career later on. Scorsese met <a href=#>Robert De Niro</a> in 1973, with whom he grew up in the Little Italy section of Manhattan. They started a partnership that later went on to be one of the most successful director-actor partnerships in modern films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scorsese-s-most-notable-works>Scorsese’s Most Notable Works</h2><p>Scorsese's first feature film, <i>Who's That Knocking At My Door</i>, came out in 1967. Then, he was the assistant director and supervising editor on <i>Woodstock</i>. He converted more than 10 hours of raw footage of the 1969 rock concert into a 3-hour movie that won an Academy Award for the best documentary. He directed Street Scenes, a 1970 documentary about protests against the Vietnam War. Directing Boxcar Bertha in 1972 was a turning point in his career. Mean Streets in 1973 was another success from Scorsese. He possessed great camera techniques and frank dialogues in his scripts. With his exceptional vision, when he teamed up with Robert De Niro and Keitel, it <a href=#>worked wonders on the screen</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scorsese has won many awards and received acclaim for his work in his career.

Ellen Burstyn also won the Oscar for best actress for the film helping Scorsese reach new heights. <i>Taxi Driver</i> in 1976 earned Oscar Nominations for De Niro, Fister and Herrmann. It was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. <i>New York, New York</i> and <i>The Lst Waltz</i> are some of his other notable works from his prime.</p><p>Leo DiCaprio and Scorsese brought out some of the finest magic on screen when the duo worked together on projects like <a href=#><i>The Departed, Shutter Island, </i>and<i> Wolf Of The Wall Street</i></a>.
