Her brother’s name is Nicholas Karayiannis. Nicholas, also known as “DJ Nick Blast,” works as an executive at a New York restaurant. Vicky adheres to traditional Greek values because her parents are of Greek descent. Her ancestors ran restaurants and worked in the music industry.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=vicky-karayiannis-husband-vicky-karayiannis-christopher-cornell></span><span>Vicky Karayiannis Husband | Vicky Karayiannis Christopher Cornell</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vicky first met Chris in January 2003, at the ‘Hotel Plaza Athénée’ in Paris. She had come to the after-show party of the rock band ‘Audioslave.’ Vicky piqued Chris’s interest right away. They later met in London, where their love blossomed.</p><p>Chris would surprise his lady love with candles, chocolates, and flowers when he was back in Los Angeles. He finally asked Vicky to marry him at the ‘Beverly Hills Hotel.’ Chris had, interestingly, proposed to Vicky with a silver ring that she had been wearing as a pendant.</p><p>He was unprepared for the performance. A few weeks later, Chris, like a true gentleman, formally proposed to Vicky in a French bar with a ‘Harry Winston’ engagement ring.</p><p>Vicky and Chris married in a civil ceremony in 2004. The wedding took place in Paris. They were soon blessed with two children. Toni, their daughter, was born in September 2004, and Christopher Nicholas, their son, was born in December 2005.</p><p>Chris previously married music manager Susan Silver. They tied the knot in 1990 and divorced in 2004. Vicky Cornell is the stepmother of Chris and his first wife’s child, Lillian Jean Cornell.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=christopher-cornell-death></span><span>Christopher Cornell Death</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chris was discovered dead in the bathroom of his Detroit hotel, the ‘MGM Grand,’ on May 18, 2017. He was on tour with ‘Soundgarden,’ and had performed the day before. The autopsy report provided by the Wayne County medical examiner’s office later stated that Chris committed suicide by hanging and that no drugs were involved in his death.</p><p>When Vicky learned of the bad news, she immediately contacted her insurance lawyer, Kirk Pasich, to handle the media. As Vicky’s spokesperson, Pasich blamed Chris’s death on ‘Ativan,’ a drug brand. He was adamant that the singer was not suicidal and had no reason to commit suicide. The full police investigation report was made public on July 11, 2017.</p><p>Vicky was the last person to speak with Chris, according to the evidence. She had a phone conversation with Chris the night before, as she had previously stated to the police. Vicky, on the other hand, stated that Chris did not sound “OK” to her.</p><p>She claimed his speech was slurred and that he repeatedly said, “I’m just tired,” before abruptly hanging up. Vicky immediately contacted Chris’s bodyguard to inquire about his well-being. Around 1:30 a.m., Chris was declared dead. Vicky took the time to come out and express her grief. Later, she blamed her husband’s death on his doctor.</p><p>In November 2018, she and her children filed a lawsuit in ‘Los Angeles Superior Court’ against her husband’s doctor, Dr. Robert Koblin, who had prescribed drugs for his shoulder pain. Vicky claimed that the doctor should not have given Chris those drugs and that the drugs were to blame for his death.</p><p>She refused to believe the autopsy report that suggested Chris committed suicide. She suspected that her husband’s doctor had prescribed an overdose of drugs, which had altered Chris’s mind and resulted in his death.</p><p>Vicky accused Dr. Koblin of “negligently and repeatedly” prescribing “dangerous mind-altering controlled substances” to her husband, which weakened his conscious mind, impaired his ability to judge, and led him to exhibit an impulsive and uncontrolled behavioral pattern that induced suicidal intent.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, Dr. Koblin continued to prescribe lorazepam (a benzodiazepine medication) to Chris for nearly 20 months without first assessing his health status. Vicky revealed on ‘Good Morning America’ that Chris had torn his shoulder, causing him excruciating pain. He couldn’t sleep because of the pain, and it was causing him a lot of stress.</p><p>The doctors gave him a benzodiazepine, a psychoactive drug. Vicky later researched the prescribed medication and discovered that it was not to be consumed by anyone recovering from an illness. She also discovered that the drug dosage was supposed to be closely monitored and that it should not have been taken for longer than two to three weeks.</p><p>Chris had struggled with prescription drug and alcohol addiction prior to his death. The investigation reports indicated that Chris had taken the prescribed medication the night before his death, but they also stated that the drug may not have been the cause of his death. The singer was discovered with blood in his mouth and an exercise band around his neck. The final result of Vicky’s case against Dr. Koblin is still awaited.</p><h2 class=sec_heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=christopher-cornell-vicky-cornell-foundation></span><span>Christopher Cornell & Vicky Cornell Foundation</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vicky and her late husband founded the ‘Chris & Vicky Cornell Foundation,’ a charitable organization. The foundation continues to help underprivileged children who have been abused and live in poverty. Chris and Vicky founded the organization in 2012 to raise funds and support various charitable organizations that work for homeless, poor, abused, and neglected children all over the world.</p><p>In addition, the organization works with other non-profit organizations. It has also contributed to a few other charitable organizations, including ‘Phoenix House,’ the ‘International Rescue Committee,’ and ‘Childhaven.’ Vicky is now in charge of the organization’s operations.</p><p>She established the ‘Chris Cornell Music Therapy Program’ to benefit the non-profit organization ‘Childhaven,’ which is based in Seattle.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=vicky-karayiannis-salary></span><span>Vicky Karayiannis Salary</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Details about Karayiannis’s salary are not yet disclosed.
