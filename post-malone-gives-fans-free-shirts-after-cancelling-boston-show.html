The singer checked himself into hospital a week after the September incident after he woke up with "cracking sounds on the right side of my body,” he said on Twitter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kim Is Spending More On Her Kids’ Security After Kanye’s Online Antics</a></span></p><p>Post Malone then revealed he’d have to cancel his Boston concert, only hours before it was supposed to begin.</p><p>"I felt so good last night, but today it felt so different than it has before," he wrote. "I'm having a very difficult time breathing, and there's like a stabbing pain whenever I breathe or move."</p><p>At the time, Post Malone said the performance would be rescheduled and all tickets would be valid, adding, "I'm so f---ing sorry. I love y'all so much. I feel terrible, but I promise I'm going to make this up to you."</p><p>The singer took to the stage this Monday to make it up for fans, and it doesn’t seem like he disappointed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During his set, Post Malone spoke directly to the audience and thanked them for their understanding. "I'm so f***ing sorry and I just wanted to say thank you for coming out tonight ladies and gentlemen,” he told the crowd. “It means the f***ing world to me.”</p><p>The Grammy winner then told the audience that everyone could pick up their very own t-shirt on the way out.</p><p>Post Malone is back in the thick of his tour, despite his rib injury. He’ll be performing throughout North America this fall and holiday season. In the new year, he has several shows planned for Australia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer became a first-time father earlier this year when his fiancé gave birth to a daughter. Speaking to <a href=#>GQ</a> this month, Post Malone revealed how touring has changed now that he’s the father of a newborn.</p><p>“It’s really tough not being able to see her,” he explained. “But she’s coming out more often now. She’s huge, she’s super tall, and she’s such a legend and I’m just happy to see her. But it is heartbreaking having to leave and not be able to be with her all the time.”</p><p>As for whether his daughter is a fan of his music yet, Post Malone replied, “She’s going to have to like my music, I think, [or] she’s going to get used to it – I know everybody at the house plays it for her and hopefully, they’ll get stuck in her head. Kids love my music for some reason, which is awesome, so I’m hoping that she just goes with the flow on that one.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Lawyer Reveals How Tom Brady & Gisele’s Prenup Affects Their Divorce</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>GQ</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS9sL%2FTZqSapJ%2Bjsm6zyK%2BcrGWWlru0ecWrnJ5lo522s8DSZpifrJWneqStzZycpaSZo7Rurs6sq6imXai1sMOO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./louis-ck-net-worth-how-much-is-louis-ck-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Louis CK Net Worth How Much is Louis CK Worth?</span></a>
