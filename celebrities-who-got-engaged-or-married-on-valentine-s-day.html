Sometimes celebrities are so smitten that they want to show their affections for their significant other on the most romantic holiday of the year: Valentine’s Day.</p><p>From <a href=#><strong>Lady Gaga</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Taylor Kinney</strong></a> to <a href=#><strong>Meg Ryan</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Dennis Quaid</strong></a> to <a href=#><strong>Harrison Ford</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Calista Flockhart</strong></a>, stars have been honoring the love-filled day with proposals and weddings for decades. However, not every couple survived.</p><p>“I think <a href=#>women love very hard</a>. We love men. We just love with everything we have,” the&nbsp;A Star Is Born&nbsp;actress said during a November 2016 appearance on&nbsp;CBS Sunday Morning. “And sometimes I don’t know that that love is met with the type of dignity that we wish it would be met with. You know, we’re not trying to make you less of a man. We just want you to love us as deeply and as wholesomely and as fully as we love you.”</p><p>Though Valentine’s Day romance does not always last, that does not mean those left in its wake give up on it completely. “I never count anything out,” Quaid told&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;in December 2018 of <a href=#>getting married again</a>.</p><p>And marry again he did! <a href=#>Quaid quietly tied the knot with <strong>Laura Savoie</strong></a> in June 2020, less than a year after getting engaged. They initially planned to wed in April of that year in Hawaii, but the coronavirus pandemic forced them to alter the date and location of the ceremony.</p><p>Meanwhile, some continue to relish in the February 14 lovefest. “You’re going to laugh. … Find the right guy!” <a href=#><strong>Salma Hayek</strong></a> quipped to Net-a-Porter’s&nbsp;The Edit&nbsp;in February 2015 about the <a href=#>secret to a successful marriage</a>. “That is the key, and it’s so hard because there are so few of them. It’s very important that they support you. They should never make you feel bad or insecure. What’s important in a marriage is generosity, thoughtfulness, thinking of the other person all of the time. … Spend quality time together. And don’t forget over the years.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Katy Perry</strong></a>, for her part, raved over <a href=#><strong>Orlando Bloom</strong></a>’s “James Bond”-esque <a href=#>proposal</a>. “It was Valentine’s Day,” she said during a February 2019 appearance on <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a> “We went to dinner, and I thought we were gonna see some art after dinner, but we pulled up to a helicopter. … It was really sweet. He asked me to marry him in a helicopter.”</p><p>Scroll to relive the pairs who tied the knot or prepared to do so on Valentine’s Day and find out if they are still together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKa4xJupoqyZmsBuw8eoZKCnpGKyr7PAoJydZZ%2Bneq6t0augnpxdpLtuwsClnKesmaOytHnDmrBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrities-wearing-stylish-covid-19-protective-face-masks-shop.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrities Wearing Stylish COVID-19 Protective Face Masks: Shop</span></a>
