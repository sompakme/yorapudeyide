Olynyk and his bride, Jacki McNulty, have since added plenty of personal touches, including a personalized neon sign in the booze-filled butler’s pantry, a couple of Peloton bikes in one of the upstairs bedrooms and behind the stovetop in the kitchen, a custom sign that reads “KELLZ KITCHEN”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Set on almost an acre along the picturesque shore of the 111-acre Island Lake, and designed by late and lauded architect Irving Tobocman, the linear, low-slung two-story home was built in 1977 but stripped to the studs in 2020 and transformed into a sybaritic contemporary home. At almost 5,200 square feet, the cedar-accented grey stucco and glass home’s generously proportioned and light-filled open-plan living spaces are complemented by four en-suite bedrooms and a total of four and a half bathrooms.</p><p>Many of Tobocman’s signature design tropes remain intact, including the flat roof, the broad banks of floor-to-ceiling windows and numerous skylights, while new-fangled finishes and fittings include matte finish porcelain floor tile, a Savant home automation system, custom closets, and an all-black minimalist kitchen. There are statement-making light fixtures throughout the house, including in the main-floor primary suite that also boasts oversized glass sliders, an austere white marble fireplace, a gigantic walk-in closet and a bathroom bathed in natural light thanks to large skylight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A system of louvers allows for light modulation on the covered terrace outside the kitchen, while a wide swathe of lawn slopes gently toward the water where’s there’s a waterside deck and a private dock. Island Lake is designated as a “non-sports lake,” which means only hand powered and sailing vessels and low-power electric motors are permitted.</p><p>The property is available through <a href=#>Ashley Crain</a> and <a href=#>Jill Laskey</a> of <a href=#>The Agency Hall & Hunter</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>MDLBeast Soundstorm 2022: Biggest Comeback Of All Time, Five Rap Legends Light Up The Big Beast Stage With DJ Khaled</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaknZyhxm67y7KlsqNdoba0wNJmpq6sXaSzbrjApJyfqp%2BjwW6t0ZyfoqyVmMG2vsClZKGnnZp6p7vRZmpmbV2itq24yKilaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kanye-hires-melinda-gates-divorce-lawyer-to-fight-kim-kardashian.html><span>←</span><span>Kanye Hires Melinda Gates Divorce Lawyer To Fight Kim Kardashian</span></a>
