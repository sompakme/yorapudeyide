Given the ongoing <a href=#>coronavirus pandemic</a>, many celebrities have opted to have picnics instead of venturing into crowded restaurants. The alfresco dining option is not only safe and scenic, it’s also perfect for the warmer weather.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Hailey Bieber</strong></a> (née Baldwin) had <a href=#>an impromptu picnic</a> with one another in July 2020. The “Yummy” singer shared an Instagram photo of the twosome spending some quiet time together with the caption, “Lil picnic wif bae.”</p><p>In the snapshot, Justin reclined on a plaid picnic blanket while Hailey leaned against him with her arm outstretched so she could take the photo. The Grammy winner was wearing no shirt and pink shorts and had his hand down the front of his wife’s black tank top.</p><p>The cute couple’s picnic included tortilla chips with guacamole and a small meat and cheese platter. There was also a woven basket on hand that held a package of healthy apple chips.</p><p>The pair’s picnic came two days after Justin paid a visit to <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a> at the “I Love It” rapper’s Wyoming ranch, amid the <a href=#>chaotic start</a> to the Chicago native’s presidential campaign.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Pink</strong></a> and her husband, <a href=#><strong>Carey Hart</strong></a>, had a similar outing in July 2020 as well. The “lunch date,” as the “Just Give Me a Reason” songstress called it on Instagram, took place on the side of the road and included some homemade food. “He made the sandwiches,” she quipped in the caption.</p><p>As far as quarantine picnics go, <a href=#><strong>Sofia Vergara</strong></a> is quite the pro. In July 2020, she hosted a celebratory picnic for her dog’s birthday in a local park. “Park cake party for our little Bubbles,” she captioned a series of Instagram photos of the spread, which included cake and plenty of decorations.</p><p>Two months prior, the America’s Got Talent judge held another picnic with her husband, <a href=#><strong>Joe Manganiello</strong></a>. The pair enjoyed a meat and cheese platter on a picnic blanket together, before tucking into their main course — hamburgers grilled by the True Blood alum and French fries.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Additionally, Vergara held her first “patio picnic” in her backyard about a month into the health crisis in April 2020. That outing, which took place just feet from her pool, included crackers, olives and cheese, as well as a plate of food for her dog.</p><p>Scroll down to see more stars and their pretty picnics!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyxtcKtrKudo2TAta3RrGShmaaeu6h5z6Kap6GTqHqiucidZJynpp6xbn2YZqehp6SkwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./schitt-s-creek-s-emily-hampshire-apologizes-for-johnny-depp-costume.html><span>←</span><span>Schitt's Creek's Emily Hampshire Apologizes for Johnny Depp Costume</span></a>
