She is prepared to start her job in sports marketing, but her basketball-playing college boyfriend and an unanticipated life event prevent her from doing so. Years later, the two lovers cross paths, but Iris is inaccessible since she is involved in a toxic, abusive relationship, making their future seem improbable. With an estimated 200,000 copies sold, it is hardly surprising that the book won a RITA Award in 2019 for the best lengthy contemporary romance.</p><h2 id=anna-karenina-by-leo-tolstoy-1877>Anna Karenina By Leo Tolstoy (1877)</h2><p>With an estimated 300,000 copies sold, this best-selling straggling epic romantic tale transports you across continents for the sake of love. With more than 800 pages, Anna Karenina is one of the longer books, but those who persevere are richly rewarded. Leo Tolstoy takes us through a fascinating adulterous escapade and its consequences within Imperial Russian culture in what is generally regarded as the most fantastic romantic novel of all time. After Anna flees with Count Vronsky, the thrill of seeing their relationship fall apart is replaced with regret, loneliness, and paranoia. This love story paints a vivid picture of the joys and sufferings of romantic love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=romeo-and-juliet-by-william-shakespeare-1564>Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare (1564)</h2><p>With an estimated 500 thousand copies published, this is one of the most well-known archetypal love stories, inspiring endless retellings and many authors. According to Loyal Books, Romeo and Juliet is a story<a href=#> about the mismatched lovers</a> from rival families who created the majority of the rules of catastrophic love. Any aspiring love fan should read this book since it has moving passages and a climax that invented the romantic catastrophe genre.</p><h2 id=jane-eyre-by-charlotte-bront-1847>Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë (1847)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jane Eyre was a revolutionary book at the time, deftly tackling subjects like sexuality, religion, and classism. According to Britannica, Jane Eyre is an underprivileged young orphan seeking work and finding much more than she bargained for when visiting the mysterious Mr. Rochester's house. Jane, who is unsure and innocent, is drawn to her menacing employer like a magnet. The resolute, headstrong, yet utterly ordinary Jane is a rebellious breath of fresh air, especially considering that she was written when most romantic protagonists were mystically lovely. This book redefines what romance should be, with an estimated 2 million copies sold. Because of this, readers continue to like it now, more than a century later.</p><h2 id=the-time-traveler-s-wife-2003-by-audrey-niffenegger>The Time Traveler’s Wife (2003) by Audrey Niffenegger</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Niffenegger's debut book, widely praised for its original blending of science fiction and romance, chronicles the lives of Henry and Clare.

The <a href=#>passionate yet complicated relationship</a> between Henry and Clare develops over time, survives, and traps them in an improbable romantic trap that tests the power of fate and luxuriates in the bonds of love. The book won the British Book Award, Exclusive Books Boeke Prize, and sold over 2.5 million copies.</p><h2 id=love-story-1970-by-erich-segal>Love Story (1970) by Erich Segal</h2><p>Love Story, frequently referred to as the Romeo and Juliet of the 20th century, was the top-selling love novel when it was first published, was translated into more than 20 languages, and underwent numerous adaptations. In it, Segal narrates the tale of two lovers, Oliver and Jenifer, who come from different backgrounds but whose love grows until it forces them to deal with unexpected events. Worldwide, more than 20 million books were sold and Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw starred in the hit movie adaptation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=outlander-1991-by-diana-gabaldon>Outlander (1991) by Diana Gabaldon</h2><p>Although Gabaldon did not favor romance as a motif in her books, Outlander, published in 1991, received the RITA Award for outstanding romance the same year it was released. The series, which incorporates aspects of historical fiction <a href=#>with a beautiful romance</a>, adventure, and conventional fantasy, has sold over 25 million copies and is a blend of numerous genres.
