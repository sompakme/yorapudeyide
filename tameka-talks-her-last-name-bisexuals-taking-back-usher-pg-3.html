Maybe that’s what he was doing or does, I don’t know. But it’s not something I’m into.</span></p><p><strong><span>Another thing most question is your last name. Any special reason for keeping it Raymond?</span></strong><span><br>[</span><span>Laughs</span><span>] I don’t think because a relationship doesn’t work, you have to change your name back. It’s an asinine question. Why not? Prior to getting married I kept my ex-husband’s last name. People have such a short expectancy for marriage that when they divorce it’s ‘Why does she still have his name?’ Dude, I was supposed to keep his name until I die. I wasn’t supposed to get a divorce [</span><span>laughs</span><span>].</span><span id=more-41740></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><span><strong>“<span>I don’t know what that [911 call] was about</span>. I laughed at [Usher] so hard when I heard [the audio] and said ‘You sound so crazy.’ He’s embarrassed by it.”</strong></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span>If Usher got his shit together, do you think the love could be easily rekindled?</span></strong><span><br>No, I don’t know. I’m not anticipating it. I’m not working toward it. But it’s [also] not a closed chapter. I’m not saying that I’m not open for discussion on it, but it’s not something I’m working on.</span></p><p><strong><span>If he came back tomorrow, would you take him back?</span></strong><span><br>I don’t know. I’ve closed the chapter of having Usher as my mate. Now am I willing to reopen it? I can’t say. Do I still love him? I love him very much and you marry someone with the intent of sitting in a rocker with the person. I have sons that look just like him, so I have to deal with him pretty much every day.</span></p><p><strong><span>Have you dated since the divorce?</span></strong><span><br>I’ve gone on a date or two. But I’m not dating anyone right now.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Because this is your second divorce, have you ever been tempted to say ‘Man, fuck Black men’?</span></strong><span><br>No. I still like those guys [</span><span>laughs</span><span>]. They still do something for me.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Ha! Just to clear up a rumor you’ve dodged in the past—did you key Usher’s car in October?</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6murrHKmmStmZygwG60xKtkpZmjqXqvrcyeZJuho5rFtq3LrGStmZueu6h5wZqapGWlqLWmvoypnmZrXWl%2BeICPaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rapper-pasto-flocco-age-real-name-girlfriend-instagram-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Rapper: Pasto Flocco Age, Real Name, Girlfriend Instagram &amp;amp; Net Worth</span></a>
