The recent episode was all about Tyler, potentially putting himself on the block for Da’Vonne and Bayleigh, though ultimately, that was a no-go, with Christmas and his alliance turning down the notion.</p><p>The fans felt as though it was just a way for production to stir the pot and add a little bit more drama. In truth, fans weren’t pleased that they didn’t shed enough of a light on another touchy matter, Ian’s struggle with autism.</p><p>A lot of his struggle was barely shown on the episode, instead, we just got a quick run-down that he was set to miss the competition. What the show didn’t show its viewers was the backlash that apparently took place among the houseguests, it is said that some would even go as far as to mock Ian.
