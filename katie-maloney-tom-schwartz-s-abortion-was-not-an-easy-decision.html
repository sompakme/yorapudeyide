I don’t think we should shy away from them. I think we should bring more attention to them. I just wanted to follow my heart.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Katie-Maloney-Tom-Schwartz-Reflect-Snap-Decision-Have-Abortion-0001.jpg><p>The “You’re Gonna Love Me” podcast host noted that she only “recently told” her parents, saying, “I didn’t want to hear what other people thought about it and I didn’t want others to try to change my mind.”</p><p>Schwartz, 39, who “never told anyone” about the pregnancy termination, chimed in, “We were a disaster [back then]. Highs and lows but tomorrow was never promised at that point in our relationship. … It was not a snap decision, and it wasn’t an easy decision, but it was our decision.”</p><p>Maloney agreed, pointing out that “pregnancy won’t fix a relationship that isn’t strong enough to begin with.”</p><p>The couple are currently<a href=#> trying to conceive their first child</a>. While documenting their fertility journey on season 9 of the show,<a href=#> they revealed their past abortion</a>.</p><p>“Tom and I’d been together for a year, and it was not pretty. Like, we fought all the time,” Maloney said in an October 2021 episode. “I wanted it to work out, but I was just like if anything, he’s going to leave and I’m going to be a single mom. … Everyone, every woman, every person should be able to decide what’s best for them.”</p><p>The Witches of WeHo cofounder added at the time: “I think we would have broke[n] up and [been] like, ‘This is too much.’ But we would have been good parents.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When the former SUR waitress was subsequently slammed via Instagram for the decision, she clapped back earlier this month. “Have the day you deserve,” she told a troll who told her <a href=#>she didn’t “deserve” a baby</a>.</p><p>Maloney isn’t hoping to “gain sympathy” by sharing her story, she said in a November 2021 podcast episode, explaining, “[I want to] open up a part of my past that maybe would have people connect with me a little more on what I’ve been through. Maybe other people have been through something like that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGakmaSesm65wKWmp52pYsGwuYysmqGvkafBu7%2BMmpmoqqSevK951pqqZqafqXqiuoyemKyxXZmypLXSoqanZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./judah-friedlander-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Judah Friedlander Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
