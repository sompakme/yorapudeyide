First, with TLC’s 19 Kids & Counting and now with Counting On, we have watched as the kids find their true loves, get hitched and start families&nbsp;of their own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, when it comes to raising his kids, Jim Bob has some pretty strict rules they must follow, especially the girls. These rules are meant to be followed and he takes them very seriously.</p><p>Although, it seems not all his children see these rules as strongly as he does and have been known to break them in the past.</p><p>Here are 15 things the girls in the Duggar family are banned from doing and 5 that they can do, either before or after becoming engaged.</p><h2 id=no-dating-without-a-chaperone><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>No Dating Without A Chaperone</span></h2><p>This family is big on double dates.</p><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, when it comes to dating, it is not uncommon to see the Duggar parents double dating with their children. By doing this, they are making sure that things don’t go south, and their children are following the rules to a T.</p><p>If the parents are unable to go, then they send an older sibling instead.</p><h2 id=no-private-text-messages><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>No Private Text Messages</span></h2><p>Ever since cell phones made their grand debut, parents have been known to creep on their children’s texts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, Jim Duggar is one of those parents and reads all his girls’ messages. In fact, Ben Seewald once messaged Jessa, “Give me a ring,” and Jim jumped in and wrote back, “No ring yet,” along with a smiley face emoticon.</p><h2 id=divorce-is-never-an-option><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Divorce Is Never An Option</span></h2><p>Once they say their “I Do’s,” there is no “I Don’t.”</p><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, no matter what happens in the marriage, the Duggar family are in it for the long haul. For example, the topic of divorce wasn’t even allowed to be mention even after the entire scandal with Josh Duggar. In fact, his wife Anna even blamed herself for his actions.</p><h2 id=co-ed-hide-and-seek-is-now-a-no-no><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Co-Ed Hide And Seek Is Now A No No</span></h2><p>A few years ago, a scandal went public about one of Jim Bob’s sons, Josh Duggar.</p><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, because of this scandal, Jim had to change some of his family rules. One rule he made was that the children, no matter age or gender, can go out and play co-ed hide and seek anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-partying-obviously><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>No Partying&nbsp;(Obviously)</span></h2><p>This one is obviously a no brainer. Most parents wouldn't encourage their child to party.</p><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, the Duggar family's biggest indulgence is to treat themselves now and again to a yummy sugary dessert or just go around getting high of life, their romances, and their beautiful family.</p><h2 id=they-are-not-allowed-to-read-romance-novels><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>They Are Not Allowed To Read Romance Novels</span></h2><p>When it comes to genres of books, romance novels are one genre that the Duggar children are banned from reading.</p><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, the Bible warns us not to “think about gratifying the pleasure of the flesh,” meaning that romance novels are a sin. Instead, the family studies different Christian literature.</p><h2 id=dancing-and-modern-music-promotes-bad-habits><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Dancing And Modern Music Promotes Bad Habits</span></h2><p>When it comes to music and dancing in the Duggar household, Michelle Duggar, the matriarch of the family, finds that modern-day music encourages “sensual” feelings in young kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, Michelle feels that modern-day music and dancing promotes all&nbsp;the negative types of stuff kids shouldn’t be doing.</p><p>Which is why her family only listens to gospel music together.</p><h2 id=they-must-cover-up-when-swimming-and-aren-t-allowed-to-ever-go-to-the-beach><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>They Must Cover Up When Swimming And Aren't Allowed To Ever Go To The Beach</span></h2><p>When it comes to swimming, the Duggar family believe that being as conservative as possible is the way to go.</p><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, not only do the girls have to cover up when they go swimming, but they are also not allowed at the beach due to men and their inability to keep their eyes averted.</p><p>For this family, only pool parties are allowed.</p><h2 id=having-one-on-one-phone-calls-with-boys-is-against-the-rules><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Having&nbsp;One-On-One Phone Calls With Boys Is Against The Rules</span></h2><p>Just like sending text messages, the Duggar parents also monitor all incoming and outgoing calls.</p><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, Jim Bob and Michelle monitor all calls that come in and go out of their household. It seems some of their children are not too keen on this rule and gone behind their backs. For example, Jessa Duggar admitted to secretly calling Ben Seewald before they were even engaged.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=halloween-is-a-demonic-holiday-they-aren-t-allowed-to-participate-in><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Halloween Is A Demonic Holiday They Aren't Allowed To Participate In</span></h2><p>Halloween has become a holiday of boozy parties, sexy costumes, and eventful pranks.</p><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, even if one was to take out all the inappropriate behaviors, the Duggar family would still not participate.</p><p>Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar feel that magic, witches and other types of fictional creatures&nbsp;are all part of the demonic realm, a realm God wants us to stay away from.</p><h2 id=they-are-not-allowed-to-turn-down-their-husbands><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Are Not Allowed To Turn Down Their Husbands</span></h2><p>One rule Michelle made sure to bestow upon her daughters, that was also once bestowed to her by her mother was that they should never turn their spouses down.</p><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, a wife ever says no, they are always joyful, and no matter how busy, tired, or pregnant and gross they feel, they must always&nbsp;be there for their partner.</p><h2 id=no-worldly-content-is-allowed><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>No Worldly&nbsp;Content Is Allowed</span></h2><p>Back in the summer of 2015, Jim Bob wrote a note to all fathers in the world that they need to start protecting their families better by removing books, magazines, television, internet and&nbsp;any other worldly content their kids might be partaking in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, kids should only be allowed wholesome music, biographies of great Christians, and good old-fashioned family fun and games.</p><h2 id=communication-with-unwed-mothers-is-against-the-rules-even-if-they-are-family><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Communication With&nbsp;Unwed Mothers Is Against The Rules, Even If They Are Family</span></h2><p>The Duggar family is extremely loyal when it comes to their beliefs on physical relationships before marriage.</p><p>So much so that according to thehollywoodgossip.com, they wouldn’t even allow their daughter Jill, who works as a midwife, help her sister Susanne Keller when she got pregnant out of wedlock.</p><p>The Duggar parents felt that Jill didn’t need to be exposed to an unmarried mother.</p><h2 id=therapy-outside-the-family-is-not-allowed><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Therapy Outside The Family Is Not Allowed</span></h2><p>After the whole Josh Duggar scandal, the Duggar parents decided it was best to handle the entire situation “in house.”</p><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, instead of contacting the authorities and seeking professional treatment, they sent him to Reformers Unanimous, a Faith-Based Recovery Program that is Christ-centered and designed to rescue, recover and restore a person with addictive behaviors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-birth-control><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>No Birth Control?</span></h2><p>So, this has never been actually proven as a rule for the girls, but it's quite obvious that it’s not something that has ever been used in this family.</p><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, once vows are exchanged, procreation tends to rear its head quite early in the relationship. It seems like they are always pregnant, and at the same time almost too.</p><h2 id=they-are-allowed-to-have-their-own-social-media-accounts-after-marriage><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They Are Allowed To Have Their Own Social Media Accounts After Marriage</span></h2><p>Just like hand-holding, frontal hugs, needing a chaperone on dates, and always having someone in between them during car rides, this ban disappears once they are married.</p><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, once married, the girls are allowed to create their own social media accounts. Expect to see a lot of adorable pictures of their ever-growing families.</p><h2 id=they-are-allowed-to-hold-hands-after-they-are-engaged><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Are Allowed To Hold Hands After They Are Engaged</span></h2><p>Just like frontal hugs, the Duggar parents feel that hand holding is too much for a young couple in the early stages.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, when a young couple holds hands, it can cause them to go from a risk level of 0 to a risk level of 100 in the snap of a finger. Which is why they don’t allow it until after the couple becomes engaged.</p><h2 id=once-married-they-are-permitted-to-perform-chest-to-chest-hugs><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Once Married They Are Permitted To Perform Chest To Chest Hugs</span></h2><p>When it comes to hugging the opposite sex, the Duggar girls are only permitted to do side hugs.</p><p>According to thehollywoodgossip.com, full-frontal hugs are can lead to temptation or “hanky panky.” Therefore, to try and prevent any kind of temptations, they only allow their children to participate in side hugs.</p><p>Once married though, they don’t mind if their daughters do full-frontal, chest to chest hugs.</p><h2 id=they-are-allowed-to-minister-convicts-in-prison><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Are Allowed To Minister Convicts In Prison</span></h2><p>So, this one is a little out there. The Duggar parents won’t let their children associate with their sister who had a child out of wedlock, but they let them associate with prisoners. Hm.</p><p>According to the duggarfamilyblog.com, Jinger and Jessa sometimes go to the prisons in Florida and minister the prisoners there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=middlemen-in-cars-are-not-necessary-after-engagement><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Middlemen In Cars Are Not Necessary After Engagement</span></h2><p>While dating, the Duggar girls are not allowed to be alone in a car with the opposite sex.

Although, they are still restricted from any inappropriate touching.</p><p>Sources: thehollywoodgossip.com, duggarfamilyblog.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhobmWknbavs9Jmq6GdXZnCqLPAq6pmnJ%2BjwW64xK1kraCVnr9usMCunqGslafAbrDOZmxmrJiaxm6t0Z5kraeklrmtxYycpqikXay2tbSO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-marlena-campbell-marques-houston-s-ex-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Marlena Campbell?
