Gisele Bundchen and Tom Brady announced their divorce in late 2022, and although they have both been slowly moving on, it's understandably still a touchy subject.</p><p>Recently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in a sneak peek of a candid interview the supermodel gave</a>, the audience got to see a rare vulnerable moment where <strong>Gisele broke down in tears talking about the end of her marriage.</strong></p><p>In conversation with interviewer Robin Roberts, the two women spoke about how the end of a relationship is always surprising, as no one walks into a marriage expecting it to end. <strong>When asked the simple question "how are you?", Gisele Bundchen couldn't pretend and got teary, asking the camera crew for a moment to compose herself.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>The model had previously compared the divorce to the "death of a dream,"</strong> and although it still feels raw and sad, in this new chapter of her life, she's grown and learned a lot.</p><p>"Everything I've experienced, it made me realize what I want, and what I don't want," Gisele shared. "At the end of the day, if you're not truthful to who you are, then it doesn't work."</p><p>She was also asked about her co-parenting relationship with Tom Brady, and her ambiguous answer surprised a lot of people. <strong>"I think there's easier days than others," she said. "I can only control what I do."</strong></p><h2 id=gisele-avoided-questions-about-a-new-romance>Gisele Avoided Questions About A New Romance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gisele-bundchen-and-tom-brady.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While processing the end of her marriage of over a decade, taking care of her children, and advancing in her career, it seems <strong>Gisele Bundchen has also been moving on, although she appeared reluctant to speak publicly about it.</strong></p><p>She has recently been linked to Joaquim Valente, a Brazilian jiu-jitsu instructor who she's reportedly been dating for several months, but <strong>when she was asked about whether she was ready to "open up her heart" to someone new, Gisele played coy and looked away.</strong></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/here-s-what-happened-to-gisele-bundchen-s-net-worth-post-tom-brady.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Here's What Happened To Gisele Bündchen's Net Worth After Tom Brady">Here's What Happened To Gisele Bündchen's Net Worth After Tom Brady</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Gisele Bündchen's net worth is surprising, especially given how famous (and rich) her ex-husband Tom Brady is.</p><p>"Where my heart is now is where I am right now," she finally replied. "I'm living my truth, and I'm not apologizing for it."</p><p>Sources have spoken about the new relationship, which seemed to be getting serious, especially considering that <strong>the model has gone through a tough and traumatic event a couple of months ago, which was the death of her mother.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The sources stated that Joaquim Valente has been her "rock"</a> during her grieving process, and that the couple were very happy together.</strong> However, as Gisele needs to shield her children from media attention, and it hasn't been that long since her divorce, it makes sense that she's refraining from speaking about a new romance in public.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGieoquVobJurtSnm5yglaN6o77EmqKsZZSkxK9505qjpKGenHqirs6uq2acmau8s6%2FEZquopV2Xv6Kw2GaYr6eZmcBuvdSeqq2hn6PAbq3BqKytZZ6axG6%2BzqaYp5uVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./felipe-valls-sr-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Felipe Valls Sr Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
