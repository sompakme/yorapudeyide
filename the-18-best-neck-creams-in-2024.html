We did that for you—and may have lost our minds along the way.</p><p>Don’t just snatch up the first neck cream you see that tickles your fancy. You should thoroughly read each description to find your match. Here are the top factors to consider as you shop.</p><h3>Understand Your Skin Type</h3><p>Before handing over your credit card or clicking add to cart, you should understand your skin type to ensure you pick the best product. You don’t want to spend $400 on a neck cream only to discover that the ingredients give you red bumps.</p><p>There are five main skin types. Always check the product description to see which skin type your favorite neck creams are for.</p><ul><li>Dry: This skin type is easy to spot because it’s often riddled with dry, itchy patches and rough spots. Folks with dry skin may notice flare-ups due to changes in the weather, hormones, or lifestyle. If you have dry skin and are looking for a neck cream, opt for uber-moisturizing ingredients like shea butter, aloe vera, and hyaluronic acid.</li><li>Normal: This skin type is the real belle of the ball. You can throw almost any ingredient at normal skin, and it won’t bat an eyelash. Choose your favorite ingredients to fade dark spots, tighten loose skin, and minimize fine lines and wrinkles.</li><li>Sensitive: What often feels like fickle skin may just be sensitive. You probably have sensitive skin if you regularly deal with inflammation, redness, bumps, cracks, dryness, itchiness, or flakiness. When treating sensitive skin, it’s important to find formulas that don’t add stress. Opt for hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic formulas.</li><li>Combination: This skin type is harder to pin down as it often swings from oily to dry to something in-between. Combination skin regularly changes throughout the month, and some people experience changes daily. The weather, hormones, or your diet can influence this. Anyone with combination skin should have multiple products to treat it on different weeks or when it oscillates between issues.</li><li>Oily or acne-prone: If you’re dealing with bumps, blemishes, zits, excess oil, and clogged pores, then you have oily or acne-prone skin. While you may not experience a lot of excess oil or acne on your neck or chest, it may flare up occasionally. If that’s the case, look for a formula with gentle exfoliants like salicylic acid. Aloe vera is also an excellent ingredient that keeps the skin hydrated without clogging pores.</li></ul><h3>High-Quality Ingredients</h3><p>When searching for products to treat skin aging, you always want to find the best clean beauty products that use natural, organic ingredients. Also, if you want to treat aging skin, you need collagen-boosting ingredients.</p><ul><li>Hyaluronic acid: Hyaluronic acid, the reigning queen of the skincare industry, attracts extreme moisture to the skin to keep it uber-hydrated. That’s what makes it the perfect match for your neck. Hyaluronic acid makes your skin look plump, moisturized, and more firm.</li><li>Retinol: Retinol is a warrior for aging skin, especially the delicate skin on your neck. It helps increase skin cell production, exfoliates, and reduces fine lines and wrinkles. Because retinol clears out your pores, it’s also a top pick for those dealing with blemishes and acne. Neck creams with retinol help with signs of aging and give you a more youthful look.</li><li>Peptides: While there are different types of peptides, they’re all well-known for their benefits for your skin. This naturally perky ingredient supports the skin barrier, tightens and firms the skin, and minimizes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li><li>AHAs (alpha hydroxy acids): Keep your pores clear and your skin exquisitely fresh and dewy. Neck creams can minimize signs of aging while helping skin look smoother and healthier. AHAs are the perfect option if you want smoother skin, and they work exceptionally well for those with oily or acne-prone skin.</li><li>Squalane: We need more products with squalane. It’s a saturated oil that’s loaded with anti-inflammatory properties. The ingredient helps with everything from eczema to acne to signs of aging. It’s a great moisturizer and replicates natural oils found in the body.</li><li>Aloe vera: Never underestimate the power of aloe vera. It’s a versatile ingredient found in many skincare products. It works double time with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties to soothe and hydrate the skin while providing extra yummy vitamins and nutrients. Aloe vera is also known to help fade dark spots, manage acne, and reverse signs of aging.</li><li>Shea butter: You no longer have to be the guy on the block with a dry neck. Shea butter is one of nature’s best moisturizing ingredients, penetrating the skin and restoring it from the inside out. The natural ingredient locks in moisture right next to your skin. If you’ve got dry neck issues, it won’t stand a chance against shea butter.</li></ul><h3>Ingredients to Avoid</h3><p>Dryness and irritation can make the skin appear less firm and more saggy. That means if you aren’t keeping your skin hydrated, it may appear older than it really is. That’s one of the many reasons you should avoid harsh ingredients in skincare products.</p><p>Cheap products from the grocery store are often doing a lot of harm to your skin. Harmful ingredients can cause issues like dryness, flakiness, itchiness, redness, inflammation, and more.</p><p>We recommend avoiding the most popular harsh ingredients like parabens, sulfates, formaldehyde, phthalates, mineral oil, synthetic fragrances, and artificial dyes.</p><h2>Tips and Tricks for a Lovelier Neck</h2><p>There’s more to a lovely neck than using a cream twice daily. Here are some top tips and tricks for healthier neck skin.</p><h3>Stay Hydrated</h3><p>If you hate drinking water, we have bad news for you. Staying hydrated actually helps improve the skin on your neck. Along with doing other things like eating a balanced diet and getting the right amount of sleep, staying hydrated ensures your neck is not dry or dull-looking.</p><h3>Never Underestimate Face Yoga or Neck Exercises</h3><p>This isn’t your mom’s witchy Facebook group that swears the right crystal supports fighting the signs of aging. Face yoga and neck stretches or exercises are some of the best ways to improve the skin on your neck—alongside supportive neck creams.</p><p>We get it. Doing neck exercises sounds pretty weird. But they’re an incredible way to help your neck skin stay more youthful-looking and minimize loose, sagging skin.</p><p><span>You can head to Google or Youtube for a quick search if you don’t know where to start. Tons of options will come up, and you can choose one that makes you feel the most comfortable. We recommend doing the exercises in the comfort of your home the first few times before being bold and doing it in public. But heck, life is short. Do whatever you gosh darn want to.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Do neck creams actually work?</h3><p>If you’re dealing with wrinkles, fine lines, or loose, sagging skin on your neck, then certain creams can help resolve and diminish these issues. Neck creams aren’t an instant cure-all. They take time to deliver their ingredients and improve the skin on your neck. Neck creams may not have the same effects as in-office cosmetic procedures, but they certainly help keep your skin hydrated and slowly reverse skin aging and give it a tighter, firmer look.</p><h3>Are there cosmetic treatments for the neck area?</h3><p>If you’d like to visit a medical spa, you have non-surgical and surgical treatment options. Neck rejuvenation procedures usually give longer-lasting results and are more intense on the body than neck creams. Some treatment methods include injectables, microneedling, radiofrequency, and resurfacing lasers—all non-surgical options. Schedule an appointment with a plastic surgeon if you’d like a more intense neck-firming treatment.</p><h3>Can I use face cream on my neck?</h3><p>Absolutely. The best neck cream in 2024 is actually a face cream from Blu Atlas. That said, because your neck skin is very thin, most formulas contain targeted ingredients for the area. They tend to use lighter or more gentle ingredients that soothe and restore the skin. We recommend reaching for your favorite neck cream when possible, but you can also use your favorite face cream. Just remember to check the ingredient list and avoid any harsh ingredients.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>What’s the best neck cream in 2024?</h3><p>Blu Atlas Face Moisturizer is the best neck cream in 2024. Stretch that neck to the sky and glide on the best product for the skin from the bottom of your chin to the top of your clavicle.
