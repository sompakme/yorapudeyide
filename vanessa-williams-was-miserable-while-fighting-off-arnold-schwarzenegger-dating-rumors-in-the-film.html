Although the action/thriller received mixed reviews, it was a hit at the box office, bringing in $242 million off a $100 million budget. Arnold, James Caan, and Vannesa Williams were the major stars of the film.</p><p>Despite the film's success and the chemistry between Williams and Schwarzenegger, it was a difficult experience for Vanessa in particular. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Williams says she was asked to lose weight for Eraser</a>, and even considered lipo at one point. She revealed, "I remember times when I'd say, 'I'm only gonna have six almonds today. That's all. That's what I'm gonna have.'"</p><p>Coming in with a music background, Williams quickly learned that the entertainment industry was an entirely different beast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"As a singer, it's a matter of how well you sing, not if I can fit into the outfit. So, I wasn't used to being judged by how skinny I was. I remember being asked by the producer, 'Well, we'd like you to lose some weight. I literally went on a diet. I considered lipo, just to be able to be on screen," she continued. "I lost a lot of weight. I did a lot of cardio. I did a lot of Pilates and I haven't been that thin since.

However, along the way, there were rumors that started to emerge, and one of them took place a decade into their marriage.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Ranker</a>, Vanessa Williams and Arnold might've secretly spent time together off the set while shooting Eraser. It was rumored to be a short affair, and one that came to an end given that both were in marriages at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/instar29725890.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/fans-were-heartbroken-for-arnold-schwarzenegger-after-he-told-howard-stern-how-he-really-feels-about-looking-in-the-mirror-today-front-deposit-back-the-howard-stern-show_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Were Heartbroken For Arnold Schwarzenegger After He Told Howard Stern How He Really Feels About Looking In The Mirror Today</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Aging has been extremely hard for Arnold Schwarzenegger, and he told Howard Stern all about it.</span><p>For what it's worth, neither side has confirmed the story. Williams, however, got a divorce from her ex-husband a year after the film was released. She remarried in 1999 to Richard Fox, though even that marriage ended in divorce six years later. She was able to find love again in 2015, tying the knot with Jim Skrip.</p><p>As for Arnold, he's also in a happy relationship alongside physical therapist, Heather Milligan.</p><h2 id=fans-and-critics-have-different-opinions-on-eraser>Fans And Critics Have Different Opinions On Eraser</h2><p>From a financial standpoint, the film was a big success. However, critics and fans had clashing opinions. Critics at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a> rated the film 43%. Critics wrote, "Most of Eraser consists of Schwarzenegger and Williams dodging bullets and bad guys, but director Chuck Russell doesn't put much effort into the action scenes: He simply points the camera and shoots."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The stunts, even show-stopping ones such as our man throwing himself out of a plane without a parachute and landing on a car without sustaining injury, have an air of desperation about them."</p><p>Another critic wrote, "Eraser is totally meaningless summertime entertainment, but it means something, I suppose, that it has been done so well."</p><p>On the flip side, fans on <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a></strong> had lots of praise for the film looking back.</p><p>"I remember it being one of the last action movies people went to see just because Arnold was in it. Back when star power alone could sell a movie lol. That said it's a pretty decent standard 90s action movie," a fan wrote.</p><p>"This movie is terrific. You have Arnie, a badass Vanessa Williams, and a great James Caan. And an underrated James Cromwell in a small but intense role. How can you go wrong? Highly recommended for those who love 90's style action movies," another fan on Reddit adds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGitmqaVqMCiedaio6WhkaLAbq3Rp6alnF2osKnDwKuxnqaVnLSmvoydmK2hnpx6s8HMqKmsZZWnrrSx0Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maripier-morin-and-her-boyfriend-jean-philippe-perras-are-parents-to-a-beautiful-daughter.html><span>←</span><span>Maripier Morin And Her Boyfriend Jean-Philippe Perras Are Parents To A Beautiful Daughter</span></a>
