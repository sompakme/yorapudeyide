His first marriage to Cindy Silva lasted from 1978 to 1994, and they had three children together. Their divorce was one of the most expensive in Hollywood, with Costner reportedly paying around $80 million in the settlement.</p><p>He went on to marry Christine Baumgartner in 2004, and they had three children before their marriage ended in 2023. Despite having a prenuptial agreement, their divorce became complicated as Baumgartner sought increased financial support and more substantial assets than initially outlined, leading to a contentious legal battle, which largely worked out in Costner’s favor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinq6Zo3qku9KtpZ6qo2K0ornBpaCnn12Wua2xxp6bpbFdp8KqusSdZKaZoqe2orPEZpmenp%2Bnsm6wyK%2Bmq5uVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./issa-rae-s-brother-lamine-enimal-diop-dishes-on-her-engagement.html><span>←</span><span>Issa Raes Brother Lamine Enimal Diop Dishes on Her Engagement</span></a>
