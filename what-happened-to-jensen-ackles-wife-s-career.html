We're always curious, especially since it seems like it can be super hard to become a successful actor in the first place... not to mention how fun and glamorous it seems to be a highly paid actor on set. Sometimes an actor gradually moves away from starring roles in movies or on TV shows, choosing to be super picky about which projects they love. Other times, they want to focus on their family, or maybe some <a href=#>stars want to get regular jobs</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We totally get why living a simpler, calmer life appeals to celebs. Hey, we would be tired of the paparazzi, too. But sometimes, it's hard not to wonder why someone suddenly stops getting acting roles. Take Danneel Ackles, for example. Before marrying Supernatural star Jensen Ackles, the actress Danneel Harris became famous for playing Rachel Gattina on One Tree Hill. <a href=#>Jensen and Danneel fell in love</a> on a movie set in 2007. But what happened to Jensen Ackles' wife's acting career? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=danneel-39-s-acting-career>Danneel's Acting Career</h2><p>The <a href=#>One Tree Hill cast's stories</a> are sad and hard to hear, as creator Mark Schwahn was accused of sexual harassment in 2017, and fans of the teen show feel terribly for what the cast went through.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Danneel Ackles played Rachel Gattina over 52 episodes on seasons 3, 4, 5, and 7, and once she finished her time on the series, she definitely disappeared from the spotlight a bit. The actress had some guest roles on TV shows, appearing in a 2007 CSI episode and playing Nora in the How I Met Your Mother episode "Shelter Island" that aired in 2008.</p><p>In 2012, Danneel played the character of Jenn in a few episodes of Retired at 35, and she also took on some TV movie roles, playing Jill in 2012's Naughty or Nice and Julia in 2014's Baby Bootcamp.</p><p>The actress acted alongside her husband Jensen Ackles when she played Sister Jo in five episodes of Supernatural in seasons 13, 14, and 15.</p><p>It seems like Danneel taking time away from acting coincied with the star marrying Jensen Ackles and starting a family. The pair got married in 2010 and have three children: Justice (born in 2013) and twins Zeppelin and Arrow (born in 2016).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are 'Supernatural' Brothers Jared Padalecki And Jensen Ackles Still Friends?</a></span></p><h2 id=danneel-and-jensen-39-s-business>Danneel And Jensen's Business</h2><p>While some couples think that working together would be super tough, others thrive on it as they enjoy spending tons of time together and want to follow their dreams. It looks like Danneel and Jensen are totally thriving while running their business.</p><p>While Danneel Ackles has seemed to have mostly left acting behind, as her resume for the past few years has been pretty sparse, she and her husband Jensen Ackles run a brewery together.</p><p>Family Business Beer Co. is located in Dripping Springs, Texas, and anyone in the area can enjoy some great beers if they visit, along with pizza, soft pretzels, and salad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jensen and Danneel Ackles opened their brewery</a> in 2018, and according to Forbes.com, they also own the business with Danneel's brother Gino Graul.</p><p>Danneel seems to be super involved, which is great to hear about. Jensen told Forbes, "Gino is really the boots on the ground, and he's the day to day guy, while Danneel's out there multiple times per week dealing with things. When I am in town, I visit the employees to make sure they're encouraged and know they are doing a good job. So it certainly is a family business, and we all take it very seriously, but we're all enjoying it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Danneel also mentioned being interested in turning a ranch house on the brewery's property into a restaurant.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Supernatural' Star Jensen Ackles Turned Down The Chance To Be An Avenger</a></span></p><h2 id=the-39-supernatural-39-spinoff>The 'Supernatural' Spinoff</h2><p>It makes sense that Danneel and Jensen Ackles would go into business together as they did work together on Supernatural. Jensen told PopSugar that he really wanted his wife to have a great time on set and have everything go smoothy. The actor said, "I think I was more nervous than she was, to be honest. I wanted her to have a great experience, because, you know, this is kind of a show that I'm a cocaptain on, and I wanted to make sure that she was still comfortable enough to do what she's really good at. And she was."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Danneel Ackles seems to have stepped back from taking on regular roles, she's involved in the spin-off of Supernatural.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jensen and Danneel Ackles are producing The Winchesters</a>, according to Deadline.com, and the show will tell the story of Sam and Dean's mom and dad. The couple has their own production company called Chaos Machine Productions and Variety reported that they made a deal with Warner Bros. that is an "exclusive, multi-year overall deal."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What’s Next For Jensen Ackles After Supernatural?</a></span></p><p>While fans of One Tree Hill would love to watch Danneel Ackles in more TV shows and movies, it looks like she loves being a mom and is having a great time running a brewery with her husand Jensen.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What Happened Between Kristin Kreuk And Jensen Ackles?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqajmrturcKko56rXay2p7GMnZinppWauW60wKupoqtdmK6zscSrZLCgkal6qa3PqZynnZRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./siangie-twins-before-and-after-surgery-hiphop-duo-releases-million-stars-song.html><span>←</span><span>Siangie Twins Before And After Surgery, HipHop Duo Releases Million Stars Song</span></a>
