The fight was always close. Marquez was ahead by only one point at the end of Round 4 (48-47), and Pacquiao ahead by a point at the end of Round 5 (57-56.) By the sixth round, Marquez’s nose was bleeding and it appeared to be broken as he was breathing through his mouth, but he was able to land a hard punch that took Pacquiao out cold.</p><p><code><span class=embed-youtube></span></code></p><p>The night wasn’t entirely a loss for Pacquiao. The Pacman was promised at least $23 million for the fight, while Marquez was only guaranteed $6 million. Pacman also got to <a href=#>meet Mitt Romney</a>, although that could now be considered a bad omen, considering they both lost.</p><p>As for that Pacquiao vs. Mayweather fight everyone still wants to see, check out VIBE’s talk with Pacman’s trainer Freddie Roach this month on the topic below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2FCorqMppinrZWheq6t0aqsnrJdoLuwr8qsZKitpGK6orrNsmSpmZOmwqqtzmapqK2emXp3eZBra29vZ2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ar-15-forum-list-of-ar-15-discussions-and-forums.html><span>←</span><span>AR 15 Forum List of AR 15 Discussions and Forums</span></a>
