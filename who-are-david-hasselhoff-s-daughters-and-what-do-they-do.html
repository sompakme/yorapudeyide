But ultimately, that marriage gave him two daughters – Taylor Ann Hasselhoff and Hayley Hasselhoff - that he couldn’t be prouder of. Here’s what you need to know about these women.</p><h2 id=taylor-ann-hasselhoff-has-followed-in-her-dad-s-footsteps-from-the-start>Taylor Ann Hasselhoff Has Followed In Her Dad’s Footsteps From The Start</h2><p>Hasselhoff’s oldest daughter Taylor had been acting in Hollywood since she was a little girl. In fact, she even made an appearance in Baywatch when was younger. Although, surprisingly, this wasn’t her first job. “My first job ever was a dog trainer and I actually still do this!” Taylor revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">while speaking with Glitter</a>. “I love animals and training dogs honestly makes me really happy!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, Taylor had also gone to star in the movies More Than Puppy Love and Sunken City. She also appeared in the tv movie Sharknado 4: The 4th Awakens. In addition, the actress has also made a brief appearance as a nurse on the long-running soap drama The Young and the Restless.</p><p>In addition, after appearing in two reality shows with her family, Taylor also decided to join the cast of Rich Kids of Beverly Hills. She also ventured into music. After all, she one sang on a track with her famous dad when she was only a little girl. Later on, Taylor also decided to sing professionally, launching a single entitled Collide. Of the song, Taylor remarked, “This is my first single as a solo artist, so it was super important for me to have the song be organic, straight from the heart and one that sends a strong message about how important it is to love one another.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Everything We Know About Jack Nicholson’s 5 Kids</a></span></p><p>Interestingly, Taylor also plays a couple of musical instruments although she admittedly doesn’t do it professionally. “I played guitar and piano growing up but never ended up sticking with it,” she told Naluda Magazine. “Sometimes I wish I did though haha!”</p><h2 id=taylor-has-also-become-a-celebrity-realtor>Taylor Has Also Become A Celebrity Realtor</h2><p>Over the years, Taylor has also done some work that doesn’t involve going in front of the cameras. For instance, she launched the jewelry line Skulls on Fire back in 2015. More recently, she’s also ventured real estate, joining the team of celebrated broker Aaron Kirkman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the job, however, Taylor has been hesitant to use her name. “Growing up, I’ve always been known as the girl that had the celebrity dad, so that’s kind of why in real estate I’ve kind of shied away from using my full name,” she once explained. Ever since she became a real estate agent, Taylor has taken on several clients, including her father. On the show Listing Impossible, the Baywatch actor told his oldest daughter, “What I’m looking for in a home is something a little bit grander, with a driveway.” Taylor also helped sell her dad’s old place.</p><h2 id=hayley-hasselhoff-is-an-actress-and-model>Hayley Hasselhoff Is An Actress And Model</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like her older sister, Hayley also started working in Hollywood early, making appearances on Baywatch when she was younger then proceeding to star in several films and tv shows. She even joined Taylor in More Than Puppy Love and Sharknado 4: The 4th Awakens. In addition, she’s also starred in the film Fearless, as well as the tv series Pair of Kings, Huge, Loosing Exactly Nicole, and Why Women Kill. More recently, Hayley has also been attached to an upcoming thriller entitled Killing Games where she is slated to star alongside This Is Us actress Amanda Leighton.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Who Are Dustin Hoffman's 6 Kids, And What Do They Do?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a plus size model, Hayley also been a true advocate of body positivity. Having joined Ford Models at a young age of 14, she has always been vocal about the need for plus-size women to have better representation in the fashion industry. “The average size for a woman in the UK is a 16, so it should be represented,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hayley once told Superdrug</a>. “Now, I’m not saying it should only be curve – it should be all shapes and sizes – but I think people are starting to wake up. Not just during fashion week, but with shoots and articles making sure they give fashion tips to all kinds of women.”</p><p>Aside from attending to their busy careers, both Taylor and Hayley have also been extensively involved in charity work. For instance, Taylor has worked with the LA Mission and Wheels for Humanity over the years. Meanwhile, Haley has recently partnered up with OK! Magazine UK Closet Clear Out for Refuge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Without a doubt, these Hasselhoff women have done incredibly well for themselves.
