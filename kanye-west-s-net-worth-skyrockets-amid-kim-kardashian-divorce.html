<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Kanye West's Net Worth Skyrockets Amid Kim Kardashian Divorce</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>More money, less problems? <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong> </a>saw a major increase in his wealth thanks to high-profile partnerships involved in his Yeezy brand.</p><p>The 43-year-old rapper’s sneaker and clothing business — now bolstered by Adidas AG and Gap Inc. — is valued between $3.2 billion and $4.7 billion by UBS Group AG, according to <a href=#>Bloomberg</a>. A report published by the outlet on Wednesday, March 17, revealed that West’s total worth has skyrocketed to $6.6 billion. (<a href=#>Forbes</a> previously declared West a billionaire in April 2020.)</p><p>Yeezy’s collab with Gap is set to hit stores this summer and “could be worth as much as $970 million” of the brand’s value, per Bloomberg. Last year, the Grammy winner <a href=#>signed a 10-year agreement</a> to design and sell apparel under the Yeezy Gap label. West still holds total ownership and creative power within the company.</p><p>Along with the income from his Yeezy line, the “Gold Digger” artist has also accrued $122 million in cash and stock. He’s raked in an additional $110 million from his extensive catalog of music and has another $1.7 billion in other assets — including estranged wife <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>‘s Skims shapewear brand.</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in February that Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 40, <a href=#>filed for divorce from West</a> after nearly seven years of marriage. The twosome tied the knot in May 2014 and <a href=#>share four kids</a>: North, 7, Saint, 5, Chicago, 3, and Psalm, 22 months.</p><p>Although reports of the pair’s marital woes made headlines in the months leading up to their divorce, the reality of the split<a href=#> has been “especially tough”</a> for the “Heartless” rapper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kanye-West-Worth-Increases-To-6-6-Billion-Amid-Kim-Kardashian-Divorce-Inline.jpg><p>“Kanye has been trying to throw himself into work the past few weeks, but it’s been hard to stay focused with the split weighing on him,” a source exclusively revealed last month. “Kim was always Kanye’s dream girl — even before they got together — so the thought of her not being his wife anymore is a lot to take in.”</p><p>Kardashian is seeking joint legal and physical custody of her and West’s children. As they <a href=#>continue to negotiate</a> the terms of their divorce, the duo is hoping to keep things drama-free. “Kanye had moved out of the family mansion before Christmas,” an insider previously told Us.</p><p>Before submitting the paperwork, <a href=#>the KKW Beauty founder was “done”</a> with the “Stronger” artist’s “unpredictable outbursts.” In July 2020, the couple faced a serious bump in the road when West held a presidential campaign rally and discussed aborting North in front of a large crowd. The controversial remarks prompted Kardashian to seek advice from <a href=#>celeb divorce attorney <strong>Laura Wasser</strong></a>, whom she’d placed on “retainer” ahead of her filing.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen to Us editors break down Khloe Kardashian’s Photoshop nightmare in under 3 minutes!<strong><br></strong></strong></p><p>The reality TV personality also had conversations with “her financial advisors to <a href=#>figure out an exit plan</a> that would be best for her whole family,” a source said in January. “Kim has had all of her and Kanye’s financials and properties ready to be split, it’s a very fair deal for everyone.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmZ6usm7DxKyrrGWemsFuw86rq6Flo6DGs7vCpJytq12WuqqwjKSgpmWblr%2BlrdKhoJqmXZm2t7vRnJxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./casper-smart-news-us-weekly.html><span>←</span><span>Casper Smart News - Us Weekly</span></a>
