We are saddened by his departure; his contributions here at HOT 97 were great and we know him as a friend, a caring individual and significant hip hop advocate. We wish Mr Cee the best and will always consider him a family member of HOT 97.

Mr. Cee announced his resignation after battling allegations that he was involved with cross-dressing prostitutes.</p><p>Mr. Cee said his farewell hours after an audio tape leaked online of Mr. Cee allegedly soliciting sex from a popular male blogger named Bimbo Winehouse.</p><p>The DJ, known for breaking huge hip-hop acts like B.I.G. and table-turning his ‘Throwback At Noon’ mix, denied being gay during an interview with the radio station’s program director Ebro Darden back in May. The sit-down happened a week after his arrest for allegedly soliciting an undercover police officer who was posing as a prostitute.</p><p>“Let’s say if I’m lying, that’s my choice,” Cee said. “If I’m lying and I chose not to come out, that’s my choice.”</p><p>Listen at the 4:58 mark below where the voice sounds similar to Mr. Cee below.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>//www.youtube.com/embed/jGhOVlDBcjs</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6K%2Fbq%2FEnmSrnaOetK%2B%2FjKGmrWVpbHpyg5hwaWpn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-abby-acone-pregnant-fans-wants-to-know-if-fox-13-meteorologist-is-expecting-baby.html><span>←</span><span>Is Abby Acone Pregnant?
