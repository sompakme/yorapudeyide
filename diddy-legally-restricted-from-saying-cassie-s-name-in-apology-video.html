The mogul reportedly wanted to address the “Long Way 2 Go” singer, but didn’t so that he could uphold the terms of their agreement. TMZ also claimed that his attorneys had to review his apology video before it went out to ensure that he did not say her name.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Beyond Cassie, the Bad Boy founder is facing <a href=#>multiple other lawsuits</a> that will require litigation. TMZ said that his legal team is apprehensive about him making any public statements, as his words could be used against him in court.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The NDA and Diddy’s legal team’s vigilance explain why both Cassie and the “I Need A Girl” artist have mostly been silent ever since November; nonetheless, social media users and other celebrities have done more than enough to keep these allegations at the top of everyone’s minds, between the incessant jokes and opinions shared in interviews.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It’s so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life,” he said in his Sunday (May 19) Instagram video. “Sometimes you gotta do that. I was f**ked up. I mean, I hit rock bottom but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I’m disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it, I’m disgusted now.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Cassie’s <a href=#>husband, Alex Fine, </a>wrote a letter to all women and children about men who abuse women. “Men who hit women aren’t men,” he wrote. “Men who enable it and protect those people aren’t men. As men, violence against women shouldn’t be inevitable, check your brothers, your friends, and your family. Our daughters, sisters, mothers, and wives should feel protected and loved. Hold the women in your life with the upmost regard. Men who hurt women hate women.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Fine continued by expressing his love and support for those who have endured abuse. “To all the survivors, find the men and women who help and love. To all the survivors, your stories are real, and people believe you,” he wrote. “To all the survivors you’re not alone, and there are men and women who care only for your well being and safety. We want you to succeed and flourish. To all the women and children, I’m sorry you live in a world where you’re not protected, and you don’t feel equal. I want to raise my daughters in a world where they are safe and loved.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">CNN shared footage of Diddy abusing Cassie in a hotel in 2016. The footage showed him grabbing her by the neck and throwing her to the ground before kicking her twice. He also tried to drag her back to their hotel room and was later seen throwing objects at her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m2pbDYZqOen5Ghubp50Z6qraqZmMGmsIysmLKhnpx6pK3SrKCeq12jrq6xjJqnqKSfnMZuwsidnKhlYWeAdYSXaWdxaV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./6-celebs-who-quit-social-media-for-good-4-who-just-needed-a-break.html><span>←</span><span>6 Celebs Who Quit Social Media For Good (&amp;amp; 4 Who Just Needed A Break)</span></a>
