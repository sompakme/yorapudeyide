Tonight I chose the right dance partner to dance with. Conor, you are a hell of a champion.</p><p>The ridiculously hyped junior middleweight fight was witnessed by 14, 623 people at Las Vegas’ T-Mobile Arena and countless others who ordered it on Pay Per View.

While it’s reported 40-year-old Mayweather was slated to pocket $100 million, he’s expected to go home with closer to $200 million, while McGregor was promised around $30 million but will likely walk away with $100 million.</p><p>After the fight, 29-year-old McGregor gave Mayweather his just due, not only as a fighter but as a strategist in the ring.</p><p>He’s composed, he’s not that fast, he’s not that powerful, but, boy, is he composed in there,” McGregor said. “I thought it was close though, and I thought it was a bit of an early stoppage. I was just a little fatigued. He was just a lot more composed with his shots. I have to give it to him, that’s what 50 pro fights will do for you.”</p><p>The Internet was in rare form for the fight and provided A1 memes and gif.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Both men after the fight: <a href=# rel=nofollow>#MayweathervMcgregor</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/Z4jUPP9SNx</a></p><p>— .
