He is now focusing on life as a husband and father, spending as much time with his family as he can. Willis is, however, still taking time for his passions; in May 2022, he shared on Instagram a knife he was making with a fellow artist. Wil does not post on social media much, except to share information that is close to his heart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-wil-willis><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Who Is Wil Willis?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/wil-willis-closeup.jpg><p>The History Channel star was born in Portugal in 1975, remaining there only through his elementary school years.
