However, others were quick to defend the Jack in the Box ad and call out critics for being too sensitive.</p><p>Jack in the Box and the agency that created the ad, David & Goliath, stand by the commercial, telling <a href=#>AdWeek</a> in a joint statement, “This ad is not diminishing any movement, and we stand firmly against any form of harassment and value those who have the guts to combat it.”</p><p>Take a look at some varying reactions to the controversial commercial below:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jack in the box- really??!!!
