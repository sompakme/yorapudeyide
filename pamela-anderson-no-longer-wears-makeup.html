Anderson explained in a Thursday, August 17, interview with<a href=#> Elle </a>that she came to the realization after the death of her makeup artist, Alexis Vogel.</p><p>“I just felt, without Alexis, it’s just better for me not to wear makeup,” Anderson told the publication. Vogel <a href=#>died in 2019</a> at age 61 after a battle with breast cancer.</p><p>The duo met in 1993 while Anderson was shooting a cover for Playboy. During their time together, they created Anderson’s <a href=#>signature look</a>, which included filled in eyebrows and rosy cheeks. To really nail her previous grunge aesthetic, she told Elle she would rock “makeup from the day before, and a little bit of glitter from two nights before.”</p><p>Since Vogel’s passing, Anderson has opted for more neutral looks on the red carpet and even <a href=#>donned a fresh face</a> while appearing in a recent <a href=#>Aritzia’s Babaton campaign</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere in the Elle interview, Anderson opened up about her thoughts on being <a href=#>hailed a fashion icon</a>. “When I was younger, I never thought that I would be in any campaigns, especially really recognizable ones,” She elaborated, “I always felt like I was an outsider, a little bit rebellious. So I’m laughing to myself, going, ‘Wow, I feel really in the zone and accepted by my peers lately.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>This wouldn’t be the first time Anderson got candid about her influence.</p><p>In a February episode of British Vogue’s <a href=# rel>YouTube</a> Series, In the Bag, she revealed the secret to <a href=#>her signature updo</a>, pulling out a G-string. “Don’t know why I have a G-string in my purse, but don’t tell me you don’t have a scrunchie,” she said to the camera. Anderson then twisted her voluminous blonde locks into the lingerie, creating a messy bun. She explained that her iconic “tousled updo always had a pair of panties in them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pamela-Anderson-Is-Done-Wearing-Makeup-2.jpg><p>Anderson sported the messy bun through her career, and recently wore the style in March, at the Fall/Winter 2023 Versace show. She teamed the coiffure with an<a href=#> extravagant black coat</a> designed by the Italian fashion house, a matching skirt, a black turtleneck sweater and oversized sunglasses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6WurrHLmmSappSav7S7zWalqGWcpLuosdFmrp6Zoqh6rq3KnqypZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicki-minaj-addresses-pregnancy-rumors-says-i-m-just-fat.html><span>←</span><span>Nicki Minaj Addresses Pregnancy Rumors, Says I'm Just Fat</span></a>
