In many ways, they can be partly credited with why Taylor has become as successful as she is because they moved their entire life over to Nashville so that she could pursue her dreams of becoming a singer-songwriter, with her debut album firmly putting her on the map as one to watch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, despite seeming to have a good relationship with her parents, there are often questions about how good this relationship remains, especially after her parents got divorced in 2011.</p><p>Divorce changes many things, including for the children, and there are a lot of questions about whether her relationship with her parents, particularly with her Dad, is as good as it once was. Let's look further into this special relationship.</p><h2 id=what-did-taylor-swift-39-s-mom-and-dad-do>What Did Taylor Swift's Mom And Dad Do?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taylor-swift-parents.jpg><p>The jobs Taylor's mom and dad did actually proved to be very helpful in the beginning (and possibly throughout) her career. Her mom, Andrea, was a marketing manager and her dad, Scott, was a stockbroker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Launching a career as a singer can be quite tricky as many people dream of it, but only a small minority are actually able to make a living out of it; let alone the amount of <a href=#>success Taylor has been able to achieve</a>. But Taylor's parents were more than able to help with this.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Do Taylor Swift's Parents Care About Who She's Dating? Here's Everything They've Said About Her Relationships</a></span></p><p>Her dad has always been able to advise her on the financial side of things, especially when it comes to investments. Whereas her mom has been able to help her market her career, even encouraging her to take to MySpace in the early beginnings of her career to engage with fans and help get her music out there.</p><h2 id=what-did-taylor-swift-39-s-dad-do-to-her>What Did Taylor Swift's Dad Do To Her?</h2><p>Not only did Taylor's dad help her in terms of giving financial advice and moving his entire life elsewhere for her, but there are other ways that he has, allegedly, been able to help her career. He invested $300,000 into Big Machine Records, which was the record label Taylor was signed to, which was for 3%.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This has led many to question <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">whether Scott bought Taylor her career</a>, or whether her success is purely down to just Taylor and her extreme talent. It's unlikely that Scott investing 3% actually had any effect on her career, but he definitely had a positive impact on it in other areas.</p><h2 id=what-does-taylor-swift-have-to-say-about-her-parents>What Does Taylor Swift Have To Say About Her Parents?</h2><p>Taylor is said to have a <a href=#>very good relationship with her parents</a>. Especially given that they sold up their home in Pennsylvania so that the family could move all the way to Nashville in Tennessee in order for her to pursue her dreams of becoming a singer, one that she had expressed to her parents at the age of 11.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Taylor Swift Lie About How She Learned To Play The Guitar?</a></span></p><p>She even said that her parents truly believed that she could become a singer, which is likely the reason why they moved their entire lives for her. It's clear that Taylor somewhat credits them for her success and she even revealed in a MySpace post back in 2009 about the Fearless tour that her dad was joining her for the tour and said that it's "pretty priceless" having him out there with her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is completely understandable given that Taylor was quite young when she was first starting out in the music industry. She was only 19 at the time of this tour and was just 16 years old when her debut album was released, so it's more than likely that she'd want her parents out on tour with her to help her feel more at home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taylor-swift-1-1.jpg><p>She also said when accepting the Grammy Award for Album Of The Year in 2010 for her album 'Fearless' that she was really thankful for both of her parents.</p><p>She thanked her dad for encouraging her to go for her dreams and who also said that she could achieve whatever she wanted; as well as thanking her mom for being her best friend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-is-taylor-swift-39-s-relationship-with-her-dad>How Is Taylor Swift's Relationship With Her Dad?</h2><p>Whilst it's more than apparent Taylor has a good relationship with her dad, there are several reasons that show it can be assumed that she is a lot closer to her mom. For example, it was Andrea that was mostly accompanying Taylor on her tours, whilst her dad stayed at home.</p><p>There is also reason to believe that this <a href=#>distance between her mom and dad contributed to their divorce</a>, although they are still said to be relatively civil with one another. However, from some of the songs she has released, this gives fans even more reason to assume that she is much closer to her mom than her dad.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Many Songs Has Taylor Swift Written?</a></span></p><p>For example, there are many songs that Taylor has written for Andrea, such as 'The Best Day' from 'Fearless'. When she released her version of the song in 2021, she released it alongside some home videos from when she was a child, which showed just how close the pair were.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taylor-swift-mom.jpg><p>Another song that she dedicated to Andrea was 'Soon You'll Get Better' from 'Lover'. This prompted many to recognize that she has yet to dedicate a song to Scott, but whether she will in any future releases she does remains to be seen.</p><p>Despite all of this, it's very clear that she does still have a good relationship with her dad and is one that is likely to remain unbreakable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWklsatu9FmqrChlql6pLjOrJxmr5mptW60xKtknZmUZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stars-having-picnics-amid-covid-19-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Stars Having Picnics Amid COVID-19: Photos</span></a>
