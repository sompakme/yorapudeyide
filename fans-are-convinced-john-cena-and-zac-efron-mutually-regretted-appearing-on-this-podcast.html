Efron appeared alongside co-star John Cena, Andrew Santino, and Jermaine Fowler.</p><p>We'll take a look back at the awkward interview, and Bobby Lee's interview conduct. In addition, we'll take a closer look at Efron and Cena's bond during the film, and why Ricky Stanicky was the perfect project for Efron in terms of timing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_why-alexandra-daddario-and-zac-efron-s-mysterious-relationship-was-never-confirmed-despite-endless-public-flirting_bk_a1_v2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Why Alexandra Daddario And Zac Efron's Mysterious Relationship Was Never Confirmed Despite Endless Public Flirting">Why Alexandra Daddario And Zac Efron's Mysterious Relationship Was Never Confirmed Despite Endless Public Flirting</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Baywatch co-stars Alexandra Daddario and Zac Efron have been tight-lipped about their love story.</p><h2 id=bobby-lee-was-very-off-topic-during-the-bad-friends-podcast-and-fans-believe-john-cena-and-zac-efron-didn-39-t-anticipate-such-a-style-of-interview>Bobby Lee Was Very Off Topic During The Bad Friends Podcast, And Fans Believe John Cena And Zac Efron Didn't Anticipate Such A Style Of Interview</h2><p>Given Andrew Santino's involvement in Ricky Stanicky, it only made sense for the cast to promote the film on the Bad Friends podcast. That's especially true given the reach of the podcast. However, given the nature of the episode, fans felt as though John Cena and Zac Efron weren't ready for such an interview. Bobby Lee basically took up most of the conversation, while the likes of Jermaine Fowler barely said anything.</p><p>Once he finally asked a question to John Cena and Zac Efron, let's just say they fell short of expectations. Bobby Lee asked Cena how his mom was. While Efron was asked out by Lee. Credit to Cena and Efron who were complete sports during the interview, and settled in nicely despite the different atmosphere. Still, despite their easygoing nature, fans felt as though they regretted the podcast.</p><p><strong>The most liked comments with thousands of likes read, "John and Zac both awkwardly smiling regretting coming on the show within minutes."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Another fan wrote, "Cena passing the mic away at every opportunity is priceless." Another fan writes, "In the first five minutes Cena and Efron are wondering what the hell they got into."</strong></p><p>Fans also weren't happy that the two biggest stars in Hollywood had to share a microphone. In the end, it was all part of Bobby Lee's comedy.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/zac-efron.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Zac Efron Questioned For Strange Behavior On The Today Show As Fans Wonder What’s Going On">Zac Efron Questioned For Strange Behavior On The Today Show As Fans Wonder What’s Going On</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Zac claims to have an ongoing medical issue, but some fans remain convinced he's trying to hide something else.</p><p>Although the reactions seemed to be generally mixed, the podcast was a hit from a numbers' standpoint with a near 2 million views.</p><h2 id=zac-efron-and-john-cena-instantly-hit-it-off-while-filming-ricky-stanicky>Zac Efron And John Cena Instantly Hit It Off While Filming Ricky Stanicky</h2><p>This shouldn't come as a major surprise, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zac Efron and John Cena grew a 'very natural' friendship</a> during the shoot of Ricky Stanicky. Efron was especially pleased with how "efficient" the cast was, and how everyone got along so quickly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We had a really great time,” Efron says. “This is a particularly efficient group. We were shot out of a rocket in Australia. We all bonded very quickly, and it felt very, very natural.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/instar53539536.jpg><p>Efron and Cena also bonded over The Iron Claw. Efron portrayed Kevin Von Erich and, in Cena's opinion, his work was fantastic.</p><p>"Done absolutely, perfectly correct. I used to watch World Class Championship Wrestling,” Cena says. “In seeing Zac's performance, it took me back to a nostalgic moments in my youth.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Efron responded, “It was incredibly special for me,” Efron adds, “To be able to bond with John over that experience and have him come to the premiere, and his seal of approval just meant everything to me.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ttweb_john-cena-admitted-to-howard-stern-that-he-s-willing-to-do-almost-anything-in-hollywood_bk_a1_v3-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="John Cena Admitted To Howard Stern That He's Willing To Do Almost Anything In Hollywood">John Cena Admitted To Howard Stern That He's Willing To Do Almost Anything In Hollywood</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>The wrestler recently started an OnlyFans page to promote a movie and attributes some of his success to an open mind.</p><p>A great moment between the two and that chemistry was on full display during the film.</p><h2 id=zac-efron-appreciated-the-timing-of-ricky-stanicky>Zac Efron Appreciated The Timing Of Ricky Stanicky</h2><p>The timing of the project could not have been any better for Efron, who had just completed The Iron Claw. Efron admitted at that point, he really needed a laugh given the tough prep for his previous film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar53356354.jpg><p>"I needed to just laugh and have fun."</p><p>Speaking alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, Efron discussed the prep involved for The Iron Claw.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Nothing could prepare me for the wrestling. [Laughs] The physical preparation and the training, that’s something that I’ve always found very interesting. I’ve always admired people’s transformations, in particular for movie roles. I just find that dedication fascinating and special when I see it."</p><p>He continues, "So in training for this, I got to train essentially for my championship, my belt match. It all came down to, how precise is my training? Ho dedicated am I to this? How hard can I push? I think I shed a skin somewhere in those seven months where Kevin was really at the wheel. It felt honest, it felt real. I felt mentally there, as a direct result of the training."</p><p>At least from a fan perspective, both films were massive hits for Efron, adding to his impressive resume.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKCeYrCmusBmsZqbXZqzs7vNZqmen6KawbWxw2aZnqukYrOztcSnm6xloKSxpK3SrWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bebe-rexha-jokingly-strips-down-in-tiktok-video-watch.html><span>←</span><span>Bebe Rexha Jokingly Strips Down in TikTok Video: Watch</span></a>
