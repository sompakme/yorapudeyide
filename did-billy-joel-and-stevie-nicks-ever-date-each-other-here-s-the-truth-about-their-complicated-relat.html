For whatever reason, people really like to know who their favorite celebs are romantically involved with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One such rumor that has persisted for decades is the alleged relationship between iconic <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> stars Billy Joel and Stevie Nicks. Despite never publicly confirming or denying their supposed romance, fans have continued to speculate about their connection. The truth does go a bit beyond what these stars have admitted to.</p><h2 id=a-timeline-of-billy-joel-and-stevie-nick-39-s-dating-history>A Timeline Of Billy Joel And Stevie Nick's Dating History</h2><p>When it comes to whether Billy Joel and Stevie Nicks ever dated each other, relationship history and evidence play a crucial role in answering this question. While there have been rumors circulating for decades about the two iconic musicians being romantically involved with each other, there is little concrete evidence to support these claims.</p><p>However, delving deeper into their respective relationship histories can provide us with some insights into their personal lives and potential connections.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joel has had an interesting romantic history throughout his life. According to People, he has been married four times and has had several high-profile relationships with celebrities such as Christie Brinkley and Elle Macpherson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/billy-joel-and-alexa-ray-joel.jpg><p>His first marriage was to Elizabeth Weber Small in 1973, whom he met while working as a piano bar pianist in Los Angeles. They separated after nine years of marriage. He then went on to marry model Christie Brinkley in 1985 after they met on the set of his music video "Uptown Girl". The couple had a daughter together but eventually divorced in 1994.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To Billy Joel's First Wife Elizabeth Weber?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nicks, who nowadays might be more known for <a href=#>her friendship with Harry Style</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her fandom of Taylor Swift</a>, has also had her fair share of romantic entanglements throughout her life.</p><p>According to Rolling Stone, Nicks dated Eagles' frontman Don Henley during the late '70s and early '80s while still being involved with fellow Fleetwood Mac band member Mick Fleetwood. Her tumultuous relationship with Fleetwood lasted for several years before it ultimately ended for a multitude of chaotic reasons.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Some of Nick's most iconic songs</a> are based on those relationships and the struggles involved.</p><h2 id=did-billy-joel-and-stevie-nicks-ever-date>Did Billy Joel And Stevie Nicks Ever Date?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine in 2019,</a> Nicks spoke highly of Joel and their friendship over the years. She mentioned that they had stayed in touch and that she admired him greatly as a songwriter and musician. However, she did not divulge any information about their personal relationship or whether they had ever dated each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The speculation about their alleged relationship has been fueled by various sources, including tabloids, interviews, and even some of their respective songs. However, despite the persistent rumors, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that the two musicians ever dated each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/your-paragraph-text-26.png><p>The early friendship and musical collaborations between Nicks and Joel were not only the foundation of their long-lasting relationship but also a significant milestone in the music industry. Their bond began in the late 1970s when they met at a recording studio in New York City. At that time, Joel was already an established artist with several hit songs under his belt, while Nicks was on the rise as a member of Fleetwood Mac.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the main sources of speculation about Joel and Nicks' relationship is their collaboration on the song "I Don't Want to Know." The track was included on Fleetwood Mac's 1977 album "Rumours," which was produced by Joel's longtime collaborator Phil Ramone. Some fans have interpreted the song as a thinly veiled confession of love between Joel and Nicks. However, nothing has ever come of these rumors.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Billy Joel Lost Millions And Was Scammed For Not Keeping Track Of His Finances</a></span></p><p>Another factor that has contributed to rumors about Billy and Stevie's relationship is their respective personal lives. At the time when they were first rumored to be dating in the late 70s/early 80s, both musicians were going through tumultuous breakups with their partners.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billy had recently split from his Weber while <a href=#>Nicks had ended her relationship with fellow Fleetwood Mac member Lindsey Buckingham</a>. This led some fans to speculate that they found solace in each other's company during this difficult time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/depositphotos_63141821_xl.jpg><p>In fact, it seems that much of the speculation about their relationship comes from fans who are eager to see their favorite artists unite romantically. Both Joel and Nicks have had incredibly successful careers and enduring legacies in the music industry, so it's not surprising that fans would be curious about their personal lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their creative synergy continued to flourish over the years after their initial songs together, leading to many more successful collaborations. One such example was "I Will Talk and Hollywood Will Listen," which Joel wrote for Nicks's solo album "Trouble in Shangri-La." The song showcased both artists' talents beautifully, with Joel's lyrics perfectly complementing Nicks' haunting vocals.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Stevie Nicks Says Lorde Should Have Been The Third Girl In Fleetwood Mac</a></span></p><p>Beyond their musical collaborations, Nicks and Joel also shared a deep personal connection that transcended their work. They often turned to each other for support during difficult times, providing comfort and encouragement when needed most.</p><p>In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Nicks revealed that she wrote the song after hearing Joel's hit single "Just The Way You Are" while driving down a freeway in Los Angeles. She was so inspired by the melody that she pulled over to write down some lyrics before continuing her journey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's yet another of many examples of their friendship coming from a place of creativity and harmony. However, that friendship just never blossomed into a full relationship.</p><p>The timeline of Nicks' and Joel's friendship is a testament to how friendships and platonic relationships can develop into something more meaningful. Their musical collaborations are evidence of the creative energy that can be sparked when two talented artists come together. And while their romantic relationship may not have lasted, it has left an indelible mark on both of their careers that will be remembered for generations to come.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdl7atuNhmoaidnGKxosDEZqqtnaaesm66yJyirGWimrmiwMiopaygmaV8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-parnell-bio-age-height-wife-children-parents-movies-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Parnell Bio, Age, Height, Wife, Children, Parents, Movies and Net worth</span></a>
