"Hi friends, I want to share with you that I am trans, my pronouns are he/they and my name is Elliot. I feel lucky to be writing this. To be here. To have arrived at this place in my life,” he wrote.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Netflix Renews The Umbrella Academy For 3rd Season" href=#>Netflix Renews The Umbrella Academy For 3rd Season</a></span></p><p>Page urged fans to have patience, writing, "my joy is real, but it is also fragile." The actor noted that more than 40 transgender people have been murdered in 2020 alone. The actor also clarified that he is non-binary, meaning his gender identity is neither man nor woman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Page worked in Canadian television before starring in 2005’s Hard Candy with Patrick Wilson. He also played Kitty Pryde, aka Shadowcat, in 2006's <a href=#>X-Men: The Last Stand</a> and appeared in Christopher Nolan's Inception in 2010. His role in Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody’s Juno earned him an Academy Award nomination.</p><p>In Netflix's The Umbrella Academy, Page plays Vanya Hargreeves, a shy violinist with supernatural powers. Last year, Page directed the documentary There's Something in the Water, which addresses the environmental racism faced by indigenous and African Nova Scotian women.</p><p>Page came out as gay in 2014 at Time to Thrive, a conference held at Bally's Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas that focused on the <a href=#>welfare of LGBT youth</a>. "I'm here today because I am gay and because maybe I can make a difference, to help others have an easier and more hopeful time. Regardless, for me, I feel a personal obligation and a social responsibility. I am tired of hiding and I am tired of lying by omission,” Page said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Source: <a href=#>Hollywood Reporter</a></p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Mads Mikkelsen Hoping For One More Hannibal Season Based On Silence Of The Lambs" href=#>Mads Mikkelsen Hoping For One More Hannibal Season Based On Silence Of The Lambs</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmidnKGyr3nPmp6eZZ6kxG6xy6WgqKxdpa6osYycpqado2K8tsCMmqpmrKKWu7SzxKebnqpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-12-richest-comic-book-characters.html><span>←</span><span>The 12 Richest Comic Book Characters</span></a>
