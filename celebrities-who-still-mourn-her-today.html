Now, even twenty years after, fans including many A-list celebrities alike still hold on to Aaliyah's legacy and what could have been if she were still here with us.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=missy-elliot><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Missy Elliot</span></h2><p>Iconic rapper and record producer Missy Elliot was friends with Aaliyah and the pair worked together a few times before the singer's death. It is, therefore, no surprise that even now, twenty years after that tragic plane crash, Elliot still carries Aaliyah in her heart. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the singer's death, Missy Elliot shared a picture of Aaliyah accompanied by a caption reading “Babygirl All these years your IMPACT is still felt & your INFLUENCE is seen EVERYWHERE!!!...You are MISSED All around the world but NEVER 4GOTTEN We LOVE you & May your SPIRIT LIVE on 4EVER”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=timbaland><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Timbaland</span></h2><p>In celebration of this year's Women's Day, Timbaland took to his IG page with a video of Aaliyah followed by a heartwarming message describing the late singer as his baby girl.

Speaking in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with ET</a>, Damon admitted that the singer's death still felt very recent. “I was reflecting [that] there hasn't been one day since she's passed, not one in the 20 years, that I haven't either heard her name, heard her record, or seen a picture of her," Dash said. "Every single day she's present in my life and I feel lucky for that."As a way of honoring her legacy, Damon and Aaliyah's uncle Barry recently collaborated to make her songs available on streaming platforms.</p><h2 id=barry-hankerson><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Barry Hankerson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aaliyah’s uncle, Barry Hankerson who is the founder of Black Ground Records managed her career up until 1995 when her father, Michael Haughton took over.

He also has a long history of preserving Aaliyah's memory in his songs and messages. In December 2016, a track from the rapper featuring unreleased vocals from Aaliyah was leaked and with that, it became evident that Drake carries the late singer around in his heart. It, therefore, came as no surprise that the rapper is set to feature in Aaliyah's posthumous album.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Aaliyah's Final Moments Revealed As Insider Reveals Details Of Fatal Plane Crash</a></span></p><h2 id=chris-brown><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Chris Brown</span></h2><p>Over the years, it has become a habit for Chris Brown to openly talk about his love and respect for Aaliyah.

It's very difficult to hear her sing when she's not here, but we got through it."</p><h2 id=justin-skye><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Justin Skye</span></h2><p>For Justin Skye, working with Timbaland was all that was need to remind her how much she adored Aaliyah as a kid. "I think her music and her style is her lasting legacy. That is something people always try to emulate because it is something we all miss, but can never be done like how she did it because it was her authentic self," the 24-year-old once shared in an interview with Crack Magazine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ciara><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Ciara</span></h2><p>During an interview with hip hop blog That Grape Juice, Ciara had nothing but praises for Aaliyah. ‘Aaliyah was true to who she was and didn’t seem to care about it.
