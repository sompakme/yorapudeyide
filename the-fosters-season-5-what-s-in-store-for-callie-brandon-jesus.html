After last year’s gut-wrenching cliffhangers, <i>The Fosters</i> is returning for its fifth season on Tuesday, July 11 — and this one looks more promising than ever.</p><p>The season premiere picks up exactly where season 4 left off, with Callie (<b>Maia Mitchell</b>) stuck in a questionable motel with Diamond (<b>Hope Olaide Wilson</b>) and her pimp. “Callie is in a very compromised position having gone with Diamond’s pimp to hopefully get him put away,” executive producer <b>Joanna Johnson</b> told <a href=#>TV Guide</a> in an interview published on Friday, July 7.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/the-fosters-245d7904-8e46-432c-9e84-2bec424a09e7.jpg><p>“She knows now that the phone her mom is tracking [is in] the bag and that bag went out the window with someone else,” Johnson continued. “Stef [<b>Teri Polo</b>] is tracking Callie’s phone but Callie is not with her phone and we are picking up right there. It’s pretty exciting and intense.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>Meanwhile, Brandon (<b>David Lambert</b>) and Jesus (<b>Noah Centineo</b>) will still have their trust issues. “We’re not just going to kiss and make up,” the EP told TV Guide of the brothers. “They’re going to go through a journey with each other of trying to regain trust. Again, part of Jesus’ TBI [traumatic brain injury] is that he doesn’t see things completely logically and maybe can’t really process things like someone without a brain injury.”</p><p>Jesus’ health won’t improve anytime soon either. “He’s still struggling a lot,” Johnson added. “He’s not back at school yet. He’s trying to figure out what his future is. … This is something that is going to be a long-term recovery for him and the family because it affects everyone.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i>The Fosters</i> season 5 premieres on Freeform on Tuesday, July 11, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2bvLTAxKuqZquVlsCwuoxuZLCgkanAbrXNZqqtp6Kaeqe70WaamqScnrJurtGapZ2nnmK3pr%2FUrGSwbGlmg3WAjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-dehea-abraham-lloyd-polite-girlfriend-or-partner-dating-history-explored.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Dehea Abraham?
