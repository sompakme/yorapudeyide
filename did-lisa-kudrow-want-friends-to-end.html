And not just right now during the pandemic, but before that," Kudrow said in the Times interview. "I don't see a reality where 'Friends' was anything but good," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although nobody wanted to say goodbye, the show ended after ten seasons. In truth, it could've went on and on, continuing to bring in stellar numbers. Behind the scenes, a lot of the cast struggled with the finale, most notably <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston</a>. On the flip side, everyone ultimately enjoyed their own type of success once the show came to an end.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Lisa Kudrow Is The Smartest 'Friends' Cast Member</a></span></p><p>Interstingly enough, everyone had their own interpretations of the show coming to an end. At first, Lisa Kudrow was totally against it but ultimately, she revealed that it was time to pull the plug on the show.</p><h2 id=kudrow-was-split>Kudrow Was Split</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It was all fun both on and off camera,</a> For that reason, very few wanted the show to end and that included Lisa Kudrow, "Yeah, if it were up to us. I would keep going. There would come a time anyway when someone would have said, ‘We’ve had enough.’ But why not have fun until they do?&nbsp;It was just really fun. But I think we were extremely appreciative at the time. It’s not like we did not appreciate how fun it was and how good the writing was. We were all very proud and appreciative.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Lisa Kudrow Was Fired From ‘Frasier’… And How She Got ‘Friends’ The Same Year</a></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/867607-lisakudrow-mattleblanc-friends.jpeg><p>She had a change of heart later, stating that it was right to end the show. Like a lot of the others, Kudrow admits she would've never been able to pull the plug herself on the series and she's glad someone else did when they did, "I was fine with doing more [seasons]. Now I’m happy that we didn’t,” says Kudrow. “Only because, when would I have left? You really would have had to kick me out. And I think it was a good thing for me to be done.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did Lisa Kudrow Like Playing Phoebe On Friends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Surpsingly, Kudrow hasn't watched the show back since its end for a couple of reasons. One, she's scared she won't like her perforemncce on the show, which most fans know is an impossibility. Secondly, she wants to wait and watch the show alongside her fellow co-stars one day, maybe after quarantine, "'I don’t watch the show. I’m still not watching it in the hopes that one day we sit down and watch them together,' Kudrow said.</p><p>Fans would definitely be into that. For the time being, fans are eager for the reunion to take place, one that was pushed back because of the pandemic.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston And Lisa Kudrow Admit Watching 'Friends' Bloopers For Hours</a></span></p><p>Sources: Daily Mail, Cheat Sheet & Insider</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoba0rYykrJ2qn6x6uK3NrWSfqpmau6W%2FjK2mZp2emXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-look-at-vladimir-putin-s-most-expensive-real-estate-purchases.html><span>←</span><span>A Look At Vladimir Putin's Most Expensive Real-Estate Purchases</span></a>
