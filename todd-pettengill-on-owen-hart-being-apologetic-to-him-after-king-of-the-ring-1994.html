I’m a little foggy with it now, but I remember, there’s usually an Unwritten rule that you don’t put your hands on the announcer, at least there was then. There was some back and forth and then I think he had me kneel. I did it, you know, but he pushed me pretty good. Afterward, I let it all go because when you’re on oh, what are you going to do? What am I going to say, ‘Don’t touch me?’ You can’t be that way. Afterward, I went up to him and I said, ‘Look, I don’t appreciate it. Don’t touch me again, please,’” Pettingill said before noting how sorry Owen was after the occurrence.</p><p>“He could not have been more apologetic. ‘I’m sorry. I was in the heat of the moment. I’ll never do that again.’ You try to avoid [those moments] but he was, again, one of the greats, man. He could put over any storyline. He was just amazing.”</p><p>Transcription credit should go to <a href=#>Robert Defelice</a> via <a href=#>Fightful</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFtbGpoYWLBsLDDZqeerKSeu6i1y6VkqK%2BVo3qprdGt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tim-gunn-flips-through-kim-kardashian-selfie-book-iq-is-plummeting.html><span>←</span><span>Tim Gunn Flips Through Kim Kardashian Selfie Book: &amp;quot;IQ Is Plummeting&amp;quot;</span></a>
